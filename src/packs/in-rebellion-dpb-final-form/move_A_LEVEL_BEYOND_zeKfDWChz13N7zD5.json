Your transformation is an Advantage, allowing you to <em>Finish Them</em> with any stat. You do not lose this Advantage from rolling poorly to <em>Finish Them</em>. In addition, this transformation grants you a unique ability or power of your choice, such as flight or gravity control. Describe it.</p><p><strong>At the end of a scene where you transformed</strong>, you take 2 damage, and you start the next scene back in your normal form.</p>",
