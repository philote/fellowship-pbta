While all of your stats are damaged, you lose all of your other Agendas, and gain the Agenda <em>Darkness Reigns</em>.</p><p><strong>Darkness Reigns</strong><br>Your curse consumes you. Act with vengeance and lash out in despair.</p><p>When Darkness Reigns within you, you are powerful but easily manipulated. You make all rolls by rolling three dice and taking the best two.</p><p>You cannot disobey an order given to you by the Nemesis or by a Threat to the World. The Overlord can make you <em>An Offer You Can't Refuse</em> as if you were Taken Out. Anyone trying to <em>Talk Sense</em> to you rolls with Hope to do so.</p>",
