If you would be destroyed, instead damage one of your stats at no cost to your attacker. <strong>If you take damage or are destroyed while none of your stats remain, you are finally defeated,</strong> once and for all. There is no coming back for you.</p><p>Your supreme power comes with some downsides. Most notably, they can harm you without ever being near you. <strong>If the fellowship seizes a Source of Power,</strong> they may use it to erase one of your stats forever.
