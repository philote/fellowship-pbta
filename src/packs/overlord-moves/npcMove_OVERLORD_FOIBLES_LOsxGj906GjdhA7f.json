You have all of the following vulnerabilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>You are arrogant:</strong> Every setback is minor and can be dealt with. Everything is fine and you know you cannot lose.</p></li><li><p><strong>You are busy:</strong> The fellowship's destruction is not your actual goal. You have soething you want, and your focus is on getting that. <strong>When you personally engage the fellowship,</strong> your goal is not to kill them all, but to get them out of your way while you do your thing.</p></li><li><p><strong>You are honor bound:</strong> When you make a promise, you will always keep it, even against your better interests. This weakness may seem silly, but it makes for a better game when you can negotiate or gamble with the heroes and they can trust you to keep your end of the deal.</p></li></ul>",
