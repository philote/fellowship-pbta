To create a General, take any threat you like from Chapter 7 and give it the Threat to the World trait.</p><p>Your Generals follow you without question and can never become Companions to the fellowship. Generals have all the moves on this page and their own minions.</p><p>You have one Bond with each of your Generals, describing why they serve you.</p><p><strong>If one of your Generals suffers a significant failure at the fellowship's hands,</strong> you must either execute them, exile them, or give them one last chance. You can only give a General one last chance once.</p><p>You begin the game with a single General.</p><p><strong>When you could Advance Your Plans,</strong> you may recruit a new General instead.</p>",
