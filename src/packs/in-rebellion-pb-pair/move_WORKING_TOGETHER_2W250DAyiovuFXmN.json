If either of you has Hope or Despair, you both do.</p><p>When you <em>Keep Them Busy</em> together, only one of you needs to stay to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>. The other may disengage and begin <em>Working Alone</em>.</p><p>When you <em>Get Away</em> or <em>Look Closely</em> together, you may split up. If you do, each of you may choose different options from that move's list, and you are now <em>Working Alone</em>.</p><p>When one of you takes damage while <em>Working Together</em>, the other takes damage to the same stat, if it is undamaged.</p>",
