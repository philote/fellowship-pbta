You represent a heroic organization, here to right wrongs and save the world. On your own, neither of you would be good enough for this impossible task. But together, there's no way you can lose.</em></p><p><em>Play as The Pair if you want to play as buddy cops or hopeless romantics, if you want the challenge of playing two characters, if you love having the Spotlight, or if you want to be everywhere you need to be, right on time.</em></p></div><div><h2>WHO ARE THE PAIR?</h2><p><strong>Choose the option that best represents your relationship:</strong></p><h3>MASTER AND STUDENT</h3><p>One of you is teaching the other the ways of the world.</p><p>When the Master takes damage while <em>Working Together</em>, the Student does not also take damage.</p><p>Add the following option to the Paired Advancement list:</p><p>○ The Master takes The Mentor Destiny playbook. Your Student becomes your Apprentice, and takes a Basic Playbook of your choice. The Student replaces their stats and Gear with those listed in their new playbook, and is no longer part of the Pair. The Master can still <em>Work Together</em> with their Student, but otherwise, the Student can no longer use any of the Pair's Moves or Gear.</p><h3>FATED PAIR</h3><p>The two of you are inseparable, a perfect combination.</p><p>When you are <em>Working Together</em>, you roll with Hope.</p><h3>WAR BUDDIES</h3><p>You've been to hell and back together, and you're prepared to go again. Choose an extra option from each of your Gear lists, but the other one holds that Gear — the heavily armed one carries one choice of supplies, and the supplier carries one choice of weaponry.</p><p>You also both wear light armor (Armor, 1 Use), add it to your Gear.</p><h3>THE TRIO</h3><p>There are three of you! The third has +1 Grace, and assigns +1, +1, +0, -1 to their other stats. They cannot assign their -1 to a stat either of the Pair has assigned -1 to. They carry an elegant bladed weapon (Melee) and little else, and choose their own Agenda to follow.</p><p>The three of you cannot all <em>Work Together</em>. One of you is always <em>Working Alone</em>. If all three of you are in the same place when you make a Move, decide which two are <em>Working Together</em> before you roll.</p></div><div><h2>LOOK</h2><p><strong>Each member of the Pair has their own separate Look. Circle one from each list for each member, or make up your own.</strong></p><p><strong>Member 1:</strong></p><ul><li>Keen Eyes, Laughing Eyes, or Stern Eyes</li><li>Braided Hair, Messy Hair, or Practical Hair</li><li>Formal Attire, Practical Clothes, or Worn Uniform</li><li>Confident Stance, Relaxed Posture, or Watchful Bearing</li></ul><p><strong>Member 2:</strong></p><ul><li>Bright Eyes, Serious Eyes, or Thoughtful Eyes</li><li>Cropped Hair, Flowing Hair, or Hidden Hair</li><li>Casual Clothes, Fine Garments, or Travel Gear</li><li>Graceful Form, Sturdy Build, or Wiry Frame</li></ul></div><div><h2>AGENDA</h2><p><strong>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</strong></p><p><strong>Each member of the Pair has separate personal Agendas.</strong></p><h3>You both have these three Agendas:</h3><ul><li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li><li>Improve The World Around You</li><li>Tell Us Of Your People</li></ul><p><strong>Each member circles a fourth Agenda that only they follow:</strong></p><h3>Honor Above All</h3><p>Always do the right thing, even when it's difficult.</p><h3>Justice For All</h3><p>Fight for the innocent and oppressed.</p><h3>Prove Yourself</h3><p>Show the world what you're capable of.</p><h3>Protect Your Partner</h3><p>Keep your partner safe, no matter the cost.</p></div><div><h2>STATS</h2><p><strong>Each member of the Pair has separate Stats.</strong></p><p>Assign +2, +1, +1, +0, -1 to your stats.</p><p><strong>When a stat is damaged,</strong> mark the small box. You are in <strong>Despair</strong> when you roll a damaged stat.</p><p><strong>Member 1:</strong></p><ul><li>Blood</li><li>Courage</li><li>Grace</li><li>Sense</li><li>Wisdom</li></ul><p><strong>Member 2:</strong></p><ul><li>Blood</li><li>Courage</li><li>Grace</li><li>Sense</li><li>Wisdom</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"flexcol\"><div><h2>PLAYING AS THE PAIR</h2><p>The Pair is in this together, and nothing can keep them apart. You represent a heroic organization, here to right wrongs and save the world. On your own, neither of you would be good enough for this impossible task. But together, there's no way you can lose.</p><p>Play as The Pair if you want to play as buddy cops or hopeless romantics, if you want the challenge of playing two characters, if you love having the Spotlight, or if you want to be everywhere you need to be, right on time.</p></div><div><h2>ADVANCEMENT</h2><p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p><ul><li>Increase one of the Pair's stats by +1, to a max of +2.</li><li>Increase one of the Pair's Blood or Courage by +1, to a maximum of +2.</li><li>Take another Paired Custom.</li><li>Take another Paired Custom.</li><li>Take another Paired Custom, or have another player Share a Move with you.</li><li>The Pair's relationship has evolved. Choose another option from the <em>Who Are The Pair?</em> Move list.</li><li>Take a Custom move from any non-Destiny playbook (even this one).</li><li>Take a Custom move from any playbook, even this one or a Destiny playbook. The Pair can only use that move while <em>Working Together</em>.</li><li>Choose a player. They Share a Move with you. The Pair can only use that move while <em>Working Together</em>.</li><li>Choose a player. You Share a Move with them. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.</li><li>Take a Custom Move from any Destiny Playbook. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.</li><li>While <em>Working Together</em>, you are now a Threat to the World. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When facing another Threat to the World, you do not need to pay a price simply to act against them.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Pair are bound together by destiny, and cannot individually become something greater. You cannot take a Destiny playbook, but Destiny Moves can be Shared with you.</p></div><div><h2>BONDS</h2><p><strong>Each of you start with 2 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</strong></p><p>I have fallen desperately in love with _____________.</p><p>_____________ has joined our cause.</p><p>We still can't believe _____________ did that.</p><p>_____________ is our greatest rival.</p><p>I need _____________ to show us how to do that technique.</p><p>I think _____________ is so cool, but my partner can't stand them.</p><p>_____________ loves to hear our tales of old victories.</p><p>_____________ owes us money.</p><p>_____________ and I have shared in glorious victory.</p><p>I would never tarnish _____________ 's honor.</p><p><strong>Record your other bonds here:</strong></p></div><div><h2>GEAR</h2><p>You both carry an elegant bladed weapon <em>(Melee)</em>.</p><h3>One of you carries your supplies. They carry soup <em>(Food, 3 Uses)</em>, and choose two:</h3><ul><li>The hunting gear <em>(Useful, 2 Uses)</em>.</li><li>The money <em>(Precious, 2 Uses)</em>.</li><li>The other musket <em>(Ranged, Reload, Piercing)</em>.</li><li>The fancy mixed drinks <em>(Slow, Vigor, 2 Uses)</em>.</li><li>The tiny bottle of deadly poison <em>(1 Use)</em>. Anyone who drinks it will die. Threats to the World who drink it take damage instead of dying.</li></ul><h3>The other carries your weapons. They carry a musket <em>(Ranged, Reload, Piercing)</em>, and choose two:</h3><ul><li>An attack dog or trained falcon. You have one Bond with it.</li><li>A grenade <em>(Dangerous, Piercing, Thrown)</em>.</li><li>A harpoon gun <em>(Ranged, Piercing)</em>. There is a cable attaching the gun to the harpoon. You must retrieve the harpoon before you can reload.</li><li>A powerful, over-sized weapon <em>(Melee, Clumsy, Dangerous)</em>.</li><li>A set of flintlock pistols <em>(Ranged, 3 Ammo)</em>.</li></ul></div></div></div></div>",
