You think a little teamwork can stop the full force of the Empire. You think playing heroes is going to make you famous.</em></p><p><em>You think wrong. You're fools, the lot of you! You will never amount to anything. Your fellowship is weak and pitiful, while the Empire is strong and unyielding. You will be crushed, and I will be the one to crush you!</em></p><p><em>I am your Nemesis. You will learn to fear me.</em></p></div><div><h2>NAME</h2><p><strong>Choose one or two from each, or make up your own:</strong></p><p><strong>Names:</strong> <em>Aris, Catra, Deal, Ego, Fol, Malchior, Ortega, Prince, Trice, Vagris, Zeni, Zula</em></p><p><strong>Titles:</strong> <em>Baron, Blackguard, Detective, Dragon Slayer, Dutchess, Executioner, Great Evil, High Priest, Honored Warrior, Judge, Name Eater, Prince of All, The Emperor's Right Hand, The Living Dead, Truesilver, Unbroken Chain</em></p></div><div><h2>LOOK</h2><p><strong>Circle one from each list, or make up your own:</strong></p><ul><li>Dark Eyes, Hard Eyes, or Mischievous Eyes</li><li>Beautiful Hair, Cool Undercut, or Protective Helmet</li><li>Imposing Figure, Lithe Figure, or Tough and Bulky Figure</li><li>Commander's Uniform, Royal Clothes, or Shining Armor</li></ul></div><div><h2>AGENDA</h2><p><strong>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</strong></p><h3>You have these three Agendas:</h3><ul><li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li><li>Tell Us Of Your People</li><li>Improve The World Around You</li></ul><p><strong>And circle an extra Agenda that only you follow:</strong></p><h3>Inferiority Complex</h3><p>Prove your worth, at all costs, and at every opportunity.</p><h3>Pursue Justice</h3><p>The law is wrong. Fix it.</p><h3>Seek Retribution</h3><p>Hurt those truly responsible for your pain.</p></div><div><h2>STATS</h2><p>Your <strong>Iron</strong> stat is +2. Assign +2, +1, +0, -1 to your other stats.</p><p><strong>When a stat is damaged,</strong> mark the small box. You are in <strong>Despair</strong> when you roll a damaged stat.</p><ul><li>Blood</li><li>Courage</li><li>Grace</li><li>Sense</li><li>Iron</li></ul></div><div><h2>WHAT IS THE NEMESIS?</h2><p><strong>Choose the option that best represents you:</strong></p><h3>DEDICATED ELITE</h3><p>You have been given your target, and everything between you and your target is to be destroyed.</p><p>You can make Cuts against anything between you and your target. Between sessions, you may change your target. If you do, set a scene at the beginning of the next session where you are given your new task.</p><p>Name your target: _____________________________________</p><h3>HONOR-BOUND FOOL</h3><p>You can't go home until you have redeemed yourself, and stopping the fellowship is your path to redemption. You have a code of honor that gives you power, so long as you keep it.</p><p>When someone takes a hostile or deceitful action against you, you may immediately respond with a Cut.</p><p>If you break your code, you take damage and cannot make Cuts for the rest of this session.</p><p>When someone honors your code for the first time, you will honor a request they make of you.</p><p>Define your code:</p><h3>LOVELESS FAMILY</h3><p>One of them is important to you, and you will recruit or save them at all costs. The rest of the fellowship can die, for all you care.</p><p>When you act in their best interests (according to you or your cruel master), you can make Cuts.</p><p>Profess your love: ____________________________________</p><h3>BETRAYED HUNTER</h3><p>One of them has hurt you, and you will recruit or destroy them at all costs. The rest of the fellowship can do whatever they want.</p><p>You can always make Cuts against the traitor.</p><p>Identify the traitor: ___________________________________</p></div></div><div class=\"flexcol\"><div><h2>PLAYING AS THE NEMESIS</h2><p>The Nemesis is not an ally of the fellowship. They work for the Overlord or the Empire as a powerful, reliable minion. They will destroy the fellowship, no matter how many weird feelings they keep getting every time they meet.</p><p>Play as the Nemesis if you want to be a bad guy, if you want to tell a story of redemption and doing the right thing, if you like the idea of wrecking your friends for fun and profit, or if your group is just too big and the Empire player needs some extra help against all those heroes.</p></div><div><h2>ADVANCEMENT</h2><p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p><ul><li>Increase one of your stats by +1, to a maximum of +3.</li><li>Increase one of your stats by +1, to a maximum of +2.</li><li>Gain the Wisdom stat at +1. <em>You must be using The Redeemed playbook to take this Advancement.</em></li><li>Take another Nemesis Custom.</li><li>Take another Nemesis Custom.</li><li>Take a Custom Move from any Basic or Powerful playbook.</li><li>Ask a player to Share a Move with you. If they refuse, take a Nemesis Custom.</li><li>Ask a player to Share a Move with you. If they refuse, take a Nemesis Custom. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.</li><li>Take a Custom move from any Destiny playbook.</li><li>Take a Custom move from any Destiny playbook. <em>You must be using The Redeemed playbook to take this Advancement.</em></li><li>Take a Custom Move from any Destiny Playbook. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.</li><li><strong>You have Changed.</strong> <em>You may only take this Advancement if the Fellowship has accepted you.</em> Permanently replace your playbook with The Redeemed playbook, and remove The Bad Guy and Dark Authority from that playbook. You are no longer Nemesis, and have been Redeemed.</li></ul><p>You cannot take a Destiny playbook, but Destiny Moves can be Shared with you.</p></div><div><h2>BONDS</h2><p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p><p>I will capture _____________ , no matter what the cost.</p><p>_____________ has bested me in combat.</p><p>I have defeated _____________ before.</p><p>_____________ betrayed me.</p><p>I don't understand why _____________ acts the way they do.</p><p>I trusted _____________ .</p><p>I will protect _____________ from my cruel master.</p><p>I will bring _____________ to my cruel master.</p><p>I need _____________ to understand.</p><p>My feelings for _____________ confuse me.</p><p><strong>Record your other bonds here:</strong></p></div><div><h2>GEAR</h2><p>You do not carry food or supplies.</p><p>You are a Melee weapon. In addition, choose two:</p><ul><li>A deadly blade (Melee, Piercing)</li><li>Fiery blasts (Ranged, Burning)</li><li>Clever tricks (Useful, 2 Uses)</li><li>Heavy armor (Armor, 1 Use)</li><li>High mobility (Armor, 1 Use)</li></ul></div></div></div></div>",
