You can only recruit a Threat that is controlled by the current Framework (ie, <em>from the Overlord's Army, from the Horizon's current Location, or from the Empire's Barracks</em>).</p><p>If the Framework is the Empire, you are a Leader, and you have one Leadership Move of your choice (Book 3, pg 138).</p><p>Write your Leadership Move here:</p>",
