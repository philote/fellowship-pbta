    "description": "<p>The Nemesis can make Cuts under specific situations. How and when you make your Cuts is determined by your <em>What Is The Nemesis?</em> choice and by your Dark Authority.</p><p>When the fellowship ignores you, you may Cut them.</p><p>When you Cut the fellowship or something they protect, it starts as a Soft Cut. While the cut is Soft, they may respond to it. When it becomes a Hard Cut, it happens, and you declare how the Cut plays out.</p><p>When nobody responds to a Soft Cut you made, or if they respond but fail to prevent it, it becomes a Hard Cut.</p><p>When you Cut a Companion or Threat while the fellowship can not protect them, your Cuts can be as hard or soft as you like.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts against a Threat to the World.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts while you are in Despair.</p><p><strong>The Cuts are as follows:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reveal an unwelcome truth:</strong> <em>Tell them something they don't want to hear</em></li><li><strong>Show signs of an approaching threat:</strong> <em>Introduce a new danger or complication to the scene</em></li><li><strong>Deal damage:</strong> <em>Hurt them, physically or emotionally</em></li><li><strong>Use up or take away their resources:</strong> <em>Force them to spend their Gear or supplies</em></li><li><strong>Turn their move back on them:</strong> <em>Redirect or punish the move they just made</em></li><li><strong>Separate them:</strong> <em>Take them away from their allies</em></li><li><strong>Put someone on the spot:</strong> <em>Make a situation that needs their immediate attention or else</em></li><li><strong>Present an opportunity:</strong> <em>Give them a chance to succeed or beat you</em></li><li><strong>Show a downside:</strong> <em>Take advantage of a weak point in their actions or equipment</em></li><li><strong>Tell them the consequences or requirements:</strong> <em>Stop them from doing something they want until they go through you</em></li></ul>",
