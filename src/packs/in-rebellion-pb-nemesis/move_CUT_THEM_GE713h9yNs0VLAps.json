How and when you make your Cuts is determined by your <em>What Is The Nemesis?</em> choice and by your <em>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.in-rebellion-pb-nemesis.Item.f1O93Nz30eDpxK5w]{Dark Authority}</em>.</p><p><strong>When the fellowship ignores you,</strong> you may Cut them.</p><p><strong>When you Cut the fellowship or something they protect,</strong> it starts as a Soft Cut. While the cut is Soft, they may respond to it. <strong>When it becomes a Hard Cut,</strong> it happens, and you declare how the Cut plays out.</p><p><strong>When nobody responds to a Soft Cut you made,</strong> or if they respond but fail to prevent it, it becomes a Hard Cut.</p><p><strong>When you Cut a Companion or Threat while the fellowship can not protect them,</strong> your Cuts can be as hard or soft as you like.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts against a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts while you are in Despair.</p><p><strong>The Cuts are as follows:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reveal an unwelcome truth:</strong> <em>Tell them something they don't want to hear</em></li><li><strong>Show signs of an approaching threat:</strong> <em>Introduce a new danger or complication to the scene</em></li><li><strong>Deal damage:</strong> <em>Hurt them, physically or emotionally</em></li><li><strong>Use up or take away their resources:</strong> <em>Force them to spend their Gear or supplies</em></li><li><strong>Turn their move back on them:</strong> <em>Redirect or punish the move they just made</em></li><li><strong>Separate them:</strong> <em>Take them away from their allies</em></li><li><strong>Put someone on the spot:</strong> <em>Make a situation that needs their immediate attention or else</em></li><li><strong>Present an opportunity:</strong> <em>Give them a chance to succeed or beat you</em></li><li><strong>Show a downside:</strong> <em>Take advantage of a weak point in their actions or equipment</em></li><li><strong>Tell them the consequences or requirements:</strong> <em>Stop them from doing something they want until they go through you</em></li></ul><p><span style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:rgb(120, 46, 34) rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:rgb(39, 44, 51);font-family:Roboto, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:start;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;white-space:normal;background-color:rgb(221, 222, 223);text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial\"><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></span></p>",
