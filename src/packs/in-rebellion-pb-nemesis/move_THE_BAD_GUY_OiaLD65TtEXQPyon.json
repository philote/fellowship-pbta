When there is a lull in the action, you may jump in to mess things up. Tell us where you're coming from, and take the Spotlight.</p><p>If you <em>Finish Them</em> or the fellowship <em>Finishes You</em> with Blood, on a 10+, the player who was Finished damages all their stats and becomes Taken Out. This happens instead of being killed. When rolling with other stats, apply the usual 10+ <em>Finish Them</em> results.</p><p>When you get Taken Out, you are out of play for the rest of the session, but you will <em>Recover</em> between session.</p><p>You do not <em>Recover</em> when the rest of the fellowship does.</p><p>When you join the fellowship, temporarily or otherwise, replace this playbook with <em>The Redeemed</em>. Keep all the same options you picked, including your level and Moves and stats, but use the text found on that playbook instead.</p>",
