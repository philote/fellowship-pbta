How and when you make your Cuts is determined by your <em>What Is The Redeemed?</em> choice.</p><p><strong>When you Cut a Threat,</strong> it is always a Hard Cut. After you make a Cut against them, they can respond with a Cut. After they Cut you, you may Cut them back if you still meet the trigger for your cuts.</p><p>Battles between you and a Threat may happen entirely without Moves.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts against a Threat to the World.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts while you are in Despair.</p><p><strong>The Cuts are as follows:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reveal an unwelcome truth</strong> - <em>Tell them something they don't want to hear</em></li><li><strong>Show signs of an approaching threat</strong> - <em>Introduce a new danger or complication to the scene</em></li><li><strong>Deal damage</strong> - <em>Hurt them, physically or emotionally</em></li><li><strong>Use up or take away their resources</strong> - <em>Force them to spend their Gear or supplies</em></li><li><strong>Turn their move back on them</strong> - <em>Redirect or punish the move they just made</em></li><li><strong>Separate them</strong> - <em>Take them away from their allies</em></li><li><strong>Put someone on the spot</strong> - <em>Make a situation that needs their immediate attention or else</em></li><li><strong>Present an opportunity</strong> - <em>Give them a chance to succeed or beat you</em></li><li><strong>Show a downside</strong> - <em>Take advantage of a weak point in their actions or equipment</em></li><li><strong>Tell them the consequences or requirements</strong> - <em>Stop them from doing something they want until they go through you</em></li></ul><p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>",
