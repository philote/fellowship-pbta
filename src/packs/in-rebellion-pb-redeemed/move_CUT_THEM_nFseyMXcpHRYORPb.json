    "description": "<p>The Redeemed can make Cuts under specific situations. How and when you make your Cuts is determined by your <em>What Is The Redeemed?</em> choice.</p><p><strong>When you Cut a Threat</strong>, it is always a Hard Cut. <strong>After you make a Cut against them</strong>, they can respond with a Cut. <strong>After they Cut you</strong>, you may Cut them back if you still meet the trigger for your cuts. Battles between you and a Threat may happen entirely without Moves.</p><p>You cannot make Cuts against a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>. <br />You cannot make Cuts while you are in Despair.</p><p><strong>The Cuts are as follows:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Reveal an unwelcome truth</strong> <br /><em>Tell them something they don't want to hear</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Show signs of an approaching threat</strong><br /><em>Introduce a new danger or complication to the scene</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Deal damage</strong><br /><em>Hurt them, physically or emotionally</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Use up or take away their resources</strong><br /><em>Force them to spend their Gear or supplies</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Turn their move back on them</strong><br /><em>Redirect or punish the move they just made</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Separate them</strong><br /><em>Take them away from their allies</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Put someone on the spot</strong><br /><em>Make a situation that needs their immediate attention or else</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Present an opportunity</strong><br /><em>Give them a chance to succeed or beat you</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Show a downside</strong><br /><em>Take advantage of a weak point in their actions or equipment</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Tell them the consequences or requirements</strong><br /><em>Stop them from doing something they want until they go through you</em></p>",
