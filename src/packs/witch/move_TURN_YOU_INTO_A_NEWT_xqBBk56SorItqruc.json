Hexes are narrative - tell us what they lose and what they gain, such as losing arms to gain wings, losing claws to gain suction cups, or losing speech to gain gills.</p><p>Your hexes always end at dawn's first light. Hexes never work on a <strong>Threat to the World. If you try to hex another player, </strong>they may attempt to <em>Overcome </em>your hex after you tell them what it is. Your hexes can never be directly lethal, such as taking away the ability to breathe.</p><p>Otherwise, your hexes always work every time.</p>",
