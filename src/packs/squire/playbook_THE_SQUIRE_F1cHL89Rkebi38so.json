I mean, they concern themselves with me often enough - that's what I get for stickin' my neck out - but I'm not gonna' go out of my way for any glory or fame or nothin'. I'm here because, well, it sounds like you need all the help you can get. Even if that help's just me.</em></p><p><em>I'm pretty handy, I suppose, and I know a lot of little tricks to make things easier. I'll keep us on track, no problem. We'll make it to the end of that road, and the return trip, to boot. I'll make sure of it, crossy my heart.</em></p><p><em>Oh, do you need a hand with that? I'm the Squire, let me take</em></p></div><div><h2>NAME</h2><p><strong>Choose one or two from each, or make up your own:</strong></p><p><strong>Given Names:</strong> <em>Mari, Koala, Pippi, Anya, Robin, Cassie, Elda, Orowin, Estav, Elysia, Rodgar, Samwise, Sancho, Baldrick, Sebastian, Mortimer, Cucumber, Nodwick, Arthur</em></p><p><strong>Family Names:</strong> <em>Darkminer, Underhill, Petty-Kin, Strongbow, Greenleaf, Pip, Evenstar, Hornblower, Trotter, Gamgee, Cursender, Greenhanded, Thraka</em></p></div><div><h2>LOOK</h2><p><strong>Circle one from each list, or make up your own:</strong></p><ul><li>Short Hair, Messy Hair, or Nice Hat</li><li>Peasant's Clothes or Apprentice's Uniform</li><li>Determined Eyes, Jolly Eyes, or Naive Eyes</li><li>Pudgy Body, Thin Body, or Androgynous Body</li></ul></div><div><h2>AGENDA</h2><p><strong>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</strong></p><h3>You have these three Agendas:</h3><ul><li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li><li>Tell Us Of Your People</li><li>Improve The World Around You</li></ul><p><strong>And circle a fourth Agenda that only you follow:</strong></p><h3>Adventure Time</h3><p>See what there is to see and do what there is to do.</p><h3>Friendship Is Magic</h3><p>Make friends with whoever you can, whenever you can.</p><h3>They Need Me</h3><p>Don't let them go ahead with poor decisions.</p></div><div><h2>STATS</h2><p>Your <strong>Sense </strong>stat is +2. Assign +2, +1, +0, -1 to your other stats.</p><p><strong>When a stat is damaged,</strong> mark the small box. You are in <strong>Despair</strong> when you roll a damaged stat.</p><ul><li>Blood</li><li>Courage</li><li>Grace</li><li>Sense</li><li>Wisdom</li></ul></div><div><h2>WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE?</h2><p>You do not represent anybody. You're nobody special, you aren't some champion, but you're here for a reason.</p><p><strong>Choose your purpose:</strong></p><h3>KEEP THEM SAFE</h3><p>You are here to make sure they come back home after this is all over, no matter what. <strong>When you are with someone you have a Bond with and they take harm, </strong>you may take that harm in their place.</p><h3>FOR YOUR PEOPLE</h3><p><em>Your people's champion is just not enough. You're here to keep them honest. Take their What Is A <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">        </span>? Move, and they can Share any of their moves with you, even Moves that cannot be Shared. Their Core Moves count as Squire Custom moves for you, and you can take them whenever you could take a Squire Custom.</em></p><h3>SEE THE WORLD</h3><p>You're just here to go on a fun adventure. All this Overlord stuff is just an excuse to see more than your garden, and you're going to make sure you see every- thing there is to see!</p><p><strong>Once per scene, </strong>you may ask one question from the <em>Look Closely </em>list without rolling.</p><h3>REMEMBERED BY HISTORY</h3><p>You want to be a hero so bad, even if the only way to do it is to tag along with the real heroes.</p><p><strong>Whenever anyone near you goes anywhere,</strong> you can always choose to tag along with them, even if doing so should be impossible.</p></div><div><h2>CORE MOVES</h2><p><strong>All Squires have these moves.</strong></p><h3>FAST FRIENDS</h3><p><strong>When you spend a scene by someone's side or </strong><em><strong>Speak Softly </strong></em><strong>with them,</strong> you may gain a Bond with them immediately.</p><p>You can have an unlimited number of Bonds with anybody. <strong>People who you have Bonds with do not become Companions. </strong>You do not have enough pull with the fellowship to just recruit people. Those you have Bonds with will think well of you and will try not to harm you if they can help it, regardless of their feelings for the rest of the fellowship.</p><p>You can <em>Command Lore </em>about anyone you have any Bonds with, except for your Bonds with other players. You can <em>Command Lore </em>about Companions, friends, and minions of the Overlord who you have Bonds with, but you cannot <em>Command Lore </em>about the other heroes of the fellowship or about the Overlord.</p><p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p><h3>PLEASE, JUST LISTEN</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Talk Sense </strong></em><strong>to someone,</strong> you may erase a Bond with them instead of owing them a favor.</p><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Speak Softly </strong></em><strong>with someone,</strong> you may erase a Bond with them to make them answer a question they refuse to answer.</p><h3>IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE</h3><p><strong>When you watch someone's back and keep your eyes peeled, </strong>you can roll to <em>Overcome </em>any harm against them with +Sense instead of +Blood.</p></div><div><h2>YOUR PEOPLE</h2><p>You... are different. You're a nobody. You're no champion, you're no hero. But somehow, you're here, and somehow, you are. You do not Command Lore like the others do. You have no people to call your own, no hold in this world.</p><p>But you can make friends. People like you. People trust you. And friendship is the strongest power of all. Your People aren't a culture or a society. Your People are the friends you make along the way.</p></div><div><h2>CUSTOM MOVES</h2><p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be the Squire.</strong></p><h3>EAGER APPRENTICE</h3><p><strong>When someone you have a Bond with talks you through it,</strong> you can use one of their moves. If they are another player, you can only use a move that they could Share with you. If they are a Companion or an enemy, you must damage one of your stats to use one of their moves. You may only borrow one Move per scene.</p><h3>I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS</h3><p><strong>When you're certain something's wrong here,</strong> you may ask the Overlord to tell you the safest way out, and also the quickest way out. They will answer truthfully.</p><h3>I WON'T LET YOU DOWN!</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Keep Them Busy </strong></em><strong>and get a 7-9,</strong> you may erase a Bond to take the 10+ result instead. The Bond must either be with someone you are protecting, or with someone who is helping you to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>.</p><h3>POWER OF FRIENDSHIP</h3><p>Your Bonds have the tags Precious and Useful, and you can Use them by erasing them.</p><p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p><h3>RUN FOR IT!</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Get Away </strong></em><strong>by running right past or right through the danger,</strong> roll +Courage instead of +Grace. Any allies who run after you may also roll +Courage instead of +Grace to <em>Get Away</em>.</p><h3>TEACH ME YOUR WAYS</h3><p>Choose a Move another player knows. That Move must be one they can share. They share that Move with you.</p><p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p><h3>VOICE OF REASON</h3><p>You alone are the voice of reason in this insane world. <strong>When you offer advice to another player and they ignore it,</strong> you are filled with Hope during any attempts to bail them out of whatever mess they got themselves into. Basically, if you could say \"I told you so\" after your action, you have Hope to do it.</p><h3>WE'LL MAKE IT</h3><p>Your Bonds have the Healing tag, and you can Use them by erasing them. Your Bonds can only be used to heal the person listed in them, and only while you are by their side.</p><p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p></div></div><div class=\"flexcol\"><div><h2>PLAYING AS THE SQUIRE</h2><p>The Squire isn't supposed to be here. They're here with someone else, to carry the bags, to help keep track of the horses. The Squire looks out for everyone else, makes sure the trip goes smoothly, and often gets in over their head.</p><p>Play as The Squire if you want to be the unlikely hero, the underdog who was given a chance, if you like playing the support character who smoothes out problems, or if you're the quiet type who is fine hanging back and letting the real heroes do most of the work.</p></div><div><h2>ADVANCEMENT</h2><p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong><em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p><ul><li>Increase your Courage or Wisdom by 1 (to a max of +3).</li><li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li><li>Gain another Squire Custom.</li><li>Gain another Squire Custom, or share a Move with someone.</li><li>Choose a player. They share a Move with you.</li><li>Choose a different player. They share a Move with you.</li><li><strong>You have Changed.</strong> You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. <strong>When you Change,</strong> choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li></ul></div><div><h2>BONDS</h2><p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p><p>I have <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">            </span>'s back, no matter what.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">                   </span>looks out for me.</p><p>I know I can trust <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">            </span>no matter what.</p><p>I've never even seen someone like <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">              </span>before.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">               </span>is always willing to listen to me, even when no one else has time.</p><p>I've bailed <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">              </span>out of trouble more times than I can count.</p><p>I don't know why but <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">              </span>really trusts me.</p><p>I'd do anything for <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">              </span>.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">             </span>and I have shared a moment of peace together.</p><p>I am afraid of losing <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">              </span>.</p><p>I think <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">              </span>likes me romanically, but its hard to believe.</p><p>I try so hard to live up to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">                </span>'s expectations.</p><p><strong>Record your other bonds here:</strong></p></div><div><h2>SQUIRE'S GEAR</h2><p>You start with some simple food <em>(Food, 4 Uses),</em> traveler's gear <em>(Useful, 2 Uses), </em>and a simple sword <em>(Melee).</em></p><h3>Choose what you brought to keep yourself safe:</h3><ul><li>Under-armor <em>(Armor, 1 Use) </em>and bandages <em>(Healing, Slow, 2 Uses)</em></li><li>A sturdy spear <em>(Melee, Ranged, Thrown) </em>and poultices <em>(Healing, Slow, 2 Uses)</em></li><li>A heavy crossbow <em>(Ranged, Piercing, Reload)</em></li><li>A bear trap <em>(Trap, 3 Uses). </em>It immobilizes them until they pry free. It also causes immense pain.</li></ul><h3>You were more prepared than anyone else on this adventure, and you brought along some extra supplies just in case. <strong>Choose one:</strong></h3><ul><li>A horse or pony for everyone. No one has any Bonds with them - if they are damaged, they are lost until your Recover.</li><li>Some extra food <em>(4 Uses, Food)</em></li><li>A spare weapon, with the same tags and features as a weapon someone else carries.</li><li>A bottle of rum <em>(2 Uses, Drunk then Vigor)</em></li></ul><h3>You weren't supposed to be here, but you are. What extra luck did you bring with you? <strong>Choose one:</strong></h3><ul><li>Luck of the devil <em>(1 Use). </em>Use this to completely escape harm unscathed.</li><li>A friend in need <em>(1 Use). </em>Use this to have someone helpful show up, right now.</li><li>The Overlord's Weakness, although you don't know you have it.</li></ul></div><div><h2><s>COMPANIONS</s></h2><p>A Squire's only Companions are the horses, but anyone can be a new friend.</p><h3>DONKEY</h3><p><em>Donkeys are similar to horses, but a little smaller, a little tougher, and infinitely more stubborn.</em></p><p class=\"tags\">beast of burden</p><h3>HORSE</h3><p><em>A horse, of course.</em></p><p class=\"tags\">run like the wind</p><h3>POLITICIAN</h3><p><em>They have their own agenda, but it has nothing to do with you or the Overlord. Probably.</em></p><p class=\"tags\">political power | spineless</p><h3>OGRE</h3><p><em>A simple creature, an Ogre is easily confused and easily misled.
