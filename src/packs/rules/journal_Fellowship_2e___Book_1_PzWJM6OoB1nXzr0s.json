        "content": "<h2>What is this book?</h2><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a tabletop adventure game, where you get a bunch of friends together to save the world from an evil overlord bent on destroying everything. The game is built around the adventure - traveling the world, facing down challenges, protecting the weak, and defeating the grand villain attempting to destroy everything your characters love. One player takes on the role of the villain, and everyone else takes on the role of one of the heroes of the story, and everyone works together to tell the tale of your Fellowship.</p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is about a world of History - each playbook gives its player the ability to define an entire people, their history, their lore, their past. <em>Fellowship</em> is about Loss - things are not what they used to be, and a great evil has brought about a great change in the world. <em>Fellowship</em> is about Hope - your losses will not stop you from rising up, pushing forward, and changing the world again, this time for the better.</p><p><em>Fellowship</em> has a lot to do with a great evil destroying the world if the players don't stop it, but this world is inherently optimistic. The heroes will succeed, as long as they can work together. The great evil is powerful, nearly unstoppable, but not <em>completely</em> unstoppable - with their wits, their teamwork, and the combined might of their people, the heroes <em>will</em> succeed. But it won't be easy.</p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a game about playing as the heroes in such a story, and figuring out just how they actually go about saving the world. You will go on an epic journey across the world, help people along the way, see miraculous things, and build a world around you as you fight the heart of evil itself. And if all goes well, have a lot of fun with some friends while you're at it.</p><h2>So how does a tabletop adventure game work?</h2><p>In a Tabletop Adventure Game, you need to get a bunch of friends together, along with some six-sided dice, pencils, and paper. You will write down the events that happen, build a world together, and explore it through the lens of the heroes and villain you are playing as. The dice are used when an event's outcome is in question - when you need to know how your course of action turns out, roll the dice to find out.</p><p>Basically, you're re-imagining the Lord of the Rings movies with your friends, going on a grand adventure to find and defeat the villain who has thrown the world into peril. Or maybe not Lord of the Rings, but more Avatar:</p><p>The Last Airbender, or Wakfu, or Dragon Quest, or most of the Final Fantasy series' main entries, or Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders. If it's an epic journey with a varied cast of heroes trying their best to defeat an evil final boss causing problems; that's what a game of Fellowship is.</p><p>In Fellowship, you will need to get a bunch of friends together, and decide which person wants to play the villain. Hand that person the Overlord playbook, and have everyone else choose one of the heroes in the fellowship that they want to play as. It's recommended you print off the playbooks for each hero and the Overlord in advance.</p><h2>Second Edition?</h2><p>This book is the second printing of the game. It contains a number of fixes, along with some new content. If you've been playing the first edition, you will want to know what's changed. Here is a list of patch notes:</p><ul><li><em>Finish Them</em> now determines the stat you roll based on what you want to do to them, instead of how you<em>Finish Them</em>.</li><li><em>Speak Softly</em> and<em>Look Closely</em> have new results. Same questions list.</li><li>Vigor and Drunk tags have changed.</li><li>Burning and Trap tags added to the core book (originally found in<em>The Dragon</em> and<em>The Spider</em>, respectively). Gear updated to include these.</li><li>A section on the different playbook types (Basic, Powerful, Destiny, Framework, Team) has been added to chapter 2.</li><li>The Harbinger is now a Powerful playbook.</li><li>The Heir's Gear has been updated.</li><li>The Heir's Custom<em>Foraging</em> has been replaced with<em>Field Treatment</em>.</li><li>The Orc's Custom<em>Brutally Cunning</em> has been re-written.</li><li>General wording fixes to many playbook moves.</li><li>Two new Destinies have been added: A New Beginning and The Oracle.</li><li>Most Destiny playbooks have changed.</li><li>Many Threats have had wording fixes or minor changes.</li><li>New Horde threats added to make this Overlord Army more interesting.</li><li>The**\"Tough As Nails\"** stat protects against being destroyed now.</li><li>Appendix III: Clarifications has been added. It contains answers to frequently asked questions about<em>Fellowship</em>.</li></ul>"

        "content": "<h2>What ls Fellowship?</h2><p>Fellowship, throughout this book, refers to three different things. <em>Fellowship</em>, capitalized and <em>italicized</em>, refers to this book and this game. <em>Fellowship</em> is a Cooperative Adventure Game. You play it together with a bunch of friends, and go on an imaginary adventure of your own design. One player plays as the Overlord, the powerful and probably evil being on a mission to destroy, conquer, or change<br />the world, and everyone else plays as the fellowship, a coalition of heroes dedicated to stopping the Overlord.<br />The fellowship, lowercase, refers to the coalition these players have formed. Each member of the fellowship has a Playbook to follow, which gives them their Moves, their abilities, and lets them define their culture further from there. Each member of the fellowship plays as the hero of their people, and they have full control over the culture of their people. You will be defining and exploring their culture through play.</p><p>Fellowship, proper noun, refers to the bond the fellowship has with a community. Fellowship must be earned. When the players earn the respect of a community, it will grant them Fellowship, and they will gain a bonus for it. While stopping the Overlord is the main goal of this journey, earning Fellowship is important for doing that, as it grants you powerful bonuses, safe places to rest, and backup against the Overlord's many forces.</p><p>The fellowship must unite the land, and the Fellowship they earn with the people of this world is how they do it. You earn Fellowship by gaining the respect of a community and the promise of their aid, usually by giving them something they want or solving a problem plaguing their community.</p><p><em>Fellowship</em> is about re-enacting an epic adventure series, such as <em>Lord of the Rings</em> or <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>. This book draws particularly heavily on <em>Lord of the Rings</em> for inspiration, but further <em>Fellowship</em> materials will aid your ability to play other kinds of heroes.</p><p>To play <em>Fellowship</em>, you will need to print off the playbooks for each player, which you can find at this link: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks\">http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks</a></p><p>You will need three six sided dice, preferably three per player, but you can share if you need to.</p><p>You will need pencils and erasers, for writing on your playbooks with and taking notes. Having some note cards on hand in case you want to write down more is helpful, but not necessary. The Overlord should definitely have some additional scratch paper on hand, for there is a lot for them to take notes on.</p><h2>What You Need To Know</h2><p>Everyone playing <em>Fellowship</em> needs to read this chapter! It is important. There's some additional reading you may need to do, depending on a few things. In addition, at least one player should read Chapter 2 before the first session, but it is not as important after that.</p><p><strong>This chapter</strong> covers the flow of play and how to tell a cooperative story together. It is important that everyone knows how this works before you play <em>Fellowship</em>.</p><p><strong>Chapter 2</strong> covers everything you need to know to play as a member of the fellowship. It covers your stats, how damage works, and your Agendas, Principles, and Moves. It also contains information on Bonds, Gear, and how item tags work.</p><p><strong>Chapter 3</strong> features the playbooks for each member of the fellowship. A playbook is a collection of rules and abilities that are unique to the player who has that playbook. Only the Dwarf gets to use all the information in The Dwarf playbook.</p><p><strong>Chapter 4</strong> is for starting the game. It covers how to set up the world you're going to save together, and includes some jumping-on points for your first session.</p><p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> is all about Destinies. As the fellowship grows on their journey, they will grow out of their basic playbooks, and require expanding into a new one. Destinies are expansion playbooks for taking your character farther.</p><p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> is all about playing as the Overlord, with all the rules involved in playing both the villain and the referee of the game.</p><p><strong>Chapter 7</strong> is a compendium of threats for the Overlord to use or draw inspiration from when creating their own threats. It also includes set pieces - premade encounters with a variety of threats that form a cohesive, larger threat together.</p><h2>Flow of Play</h2><p><em>Fellowship</em> is a game about the journey. Several heroes will travel the world together, seeing a variety of interesting places on their journey to stop a great evil from destroying the land. They will come across many perilous threats that must be overcome, in one way or another, all throughout their journey.</p><p>All threats are resolved in much the same way, be they a giant monster threatening your lives, a politician denying you access to what you need most, or a collapsed bridge between you and your destination. Each trial they face is a single <strong>scene</strong>, and every scene has a flow to it. <em>Fellowship</em> is all about playing out each of those little scenes, stringing them together and figuring out where you're going from here.</p><p>The flow of play for each scene goes like this:</p><ol><li><strong>Set the Scene, Set the Stakes</strong></li><li><strong>Swing the Spotlight</strong></li><li><strong>Quick Recap</strong></li></ol><h3>Set the Scene, Set the Stakes</h3><p>Whenever the players come to a new area, it is up to them and the Overlord to set the scene. The Overlord will generally take charge during this - they will let you know what is here and what is going on. The players will decide what it is they want to do next. As heroes, it should usually be something heroic or at least helpful for saving the world, although it doesn't always need to be. Once everyone knows what is going on here and what you want to do, it's time to figure out what the problem is, if there is one.</p><p>If there is a problem that must be overcome, it is time to <strong>Set The Stakes -</strong> what's on the line here? What do you want out of this encounter? What could go wrong? You don't necessarily need to say this aloud and discuss it step-by-step, but each player should have this in mind as they proceed, and the Overlord should voice a few answers aloud when setting the scene.</p><p><em>For example, the Overlord could build up a scene by saying that the bridge you need to cross has collapsed! You must get to the other side, but it's a long way down the cliff face, and a long way across the gap. Down below, you hear a raging river rapids crashing against the rocks.</em></p><p>With a quick description like that, you've set the scene and set the stakes. The players know what they need, and they know what's in their way, and that's all a scene needs to get rolling.</p><h3>Swing the Spotlight</h3><p>After Setting the Stakes, it is time to take action, and the Spotlight begins to swing around the table. The Spotlight is like the turn order of the game, but unlike in many other games, this turn order is not rigid or fixed. The Spotlight is flexible, and it goes where it needs to be. Pass the Spotlight to whoever has an idea, to start with, and then swivel it around to everyone else as the danger warrants.</p><p>When someone is in danger, they get the Spotlight to tell us how they deal with that.</p><p>When someone hasn't done something in a while, they get the Spotlight to tell us what they've been up to while everyone else has been so busy.</p><p>When someone has an idea, leaps into action, speaks for the group, or generally does anything noteworthy, they get the Spotlight.</p><p>When someone's own actions put them directly into danger, they <strong>LOSE</strong> the Spotlight, leaving their moment on a cliffhanger. The Overlord will tell you who gets the Spotlight next.</p><p>Don't let anyone keep the Spotlight for too long (unless the situation really warrants it, which it will, every once in a while), and be sure to share the Spotlight often, and with everyone. The Overlord is in charge of directing the Spotlight, and that can be a heavy responsibility. Most of the game will be played during Spotlight Time, so managing the Spotlight is extremely important.</p><p>When a player has the Spotlight, they will describe what they are doing, and the Overlord will describe how the world reacts to their actions. It is a dialogue, where both players speak back and forth until something has happened. When the player has had a long enough moment in the Spotlight, or when the danger shifts elsewhere, or when another player has something to do, or when it would make a good cliffhanger, move the Spotlight to someone else and continue from there.</p><p>It's worth mentioning the Spotlight is a metaphorical one, not a literal one. The best way to think of it is like the camera in a movie - the Spotlight goes where the action is, but it can peel back and pan around and look at other things whenever they become interesting and noteworthy.</p><p>If you want to use a physical representation of the Spotlight, you can, but you will need to pass it around constantly - it's never going to stay still. A beanbag works best, because it is soft, easy to hold, and can be tossed across a table with minimal risk, but anything small, hand-held, and not-pointy will work fine. Other good Spotlight markers: a stuffed animal, an action figure, a tennis ball, a bag of marbles, balled up paper, a talking stick, or a rubber band ball.</p><p>One upside to using a physical Spotlight is that it can help keep players engaged, and it's easy to tell if someone has had it for a long time or hasn't had it in a while when you have physical evidence of where the Spotlight has been. It's important to note that this Spotlight is only a physical reminder, and isn't absolutely necessary. If your beanbag Spotlight ends up forgotten somewhere, don't worry about it too much and just keep playing. If you need it again, you can always bring it back in, but if the Spotlight marker has been forgotten, then you probably didn't need it anyway.</p><p>Continuing the bridge example, the first player to jump in with an idea is Selenia the Elf, who decides she has just the thing for this! She tells us how the bridge is mostly collapsed, but there's still a single rope intact, a few planks of wood dangling off it. Selenia can <em><strong>stabilize and heal someone at 9:00 or past</strong></em>, so she says she's going to just run across the remaining rope without a problem.</p><p>The Overlord tells her sure, that works! You're across. But what about everyone else? Selenia shrugs and says they'll need to figure that out for themselves. The Overlord nods, and turns to the Dwarf. So, how are you getting across, Ardrik?</p><h3>Quick Recap</h3><p>The Spotlight will keep bouncing around, from player to player, until it's time to set the next scene. But before that, everyone needs to do a Quick Recap.</p><p>Tell us what happened, briefly, and check in on how everyone's doing. It can be hard to keep track of everything when the Spotlight gets in full motion, and the Quick Recap lets everyone know where they stand. Additionally, the Quick Recap is a great tool for deciding where to go next from here - when you wind down from the last scene, you have time to figure out what the next one will be.</p><p>The Quick Recap should be exactly that - quick. Don't spend too long dwelling on every little thing that happened. For the bridge example we've been using, a good recap might be something like \"So everyone made it across, without getting too banged up, and you can continue on with your journey.\" You only need to wrap up the scene, and keep the game moving forward in a coherent direction.</p><p>After that, you set the next scene, and continue play from there!</p><h2>Telling a Story</h2><p>Scenes do not exist in a vacuum - they are a part of a greater story you are telling. A set of scenes that share a common purpose is a Story. There are four main stories you will tell over and over: Journeys, Challenges, Downtime, and Showdowns.</p><p>Generally, the flow of play will be to take a Journey to somewhere important, go through some kind of Challenge in order to earn their Fellowship, spend some Downtime there, and then press onward with another Journey. Every so often, the flow of play will be interrupted by a Showdown, where the Overlord or one of their generals will appear and mess up everything.</p><p>Not every scene will be part of a Story. It's okay to add in extra scenes whenever you need them. Having a few scenes between stories is to be expected, and sometimes something will come up that requires you to interrupt a Challenge or a Journey with an important scene. A common type of mini-scene is one where the fellowship just sits down, catches their breath, and figures out what they're doing next, usually over some food and a map. Planning scenes like that usually don't have anything at stake, and this scene can happen any time the players think they need a moment before pressing on with their quest.</p><p>During a Story, the Overlord will often get a chance to set scenes telling everyone about what the Overlord is up to. The Overlord will usually advance a plan, set up a Bond, or foreshadow their next move during these scenes. During such a scene, while the players may hear about what is going on, it can be assumed the fellowship (as in, the heroes they are playing as) doesn't know about what</p><p>happened unless they go out of their way to find out, or they hear about it through some means. However, if the Overlord uses such a scene to, say, topple a city or set fire to the Elfwoods, you can assume the fellowship will hear about it as quickly as the news can reach them.</p><h3>A Long Journey</h3><p>A Journey is a story where you want to get from point A to point B. During a Journey, each player tells us one event that happened along the way, starting with whoever you like. The Overlord may frame the event by asking specific questions, such as \"what did you find just off the beaten path?\" or \"who did you meet on the road?\" or \"what was really dangerous about this leg of the journey?\"</p><p>After a player describes the event, they choose another player at the table, and that player must tell us how they handled the event. Give each event as much or as little detail as it needs. During this montage, the Overlord also gets a turn, to describe an event that is directly related to the Overlord or their minions, and tell us what they're up to or how they get in the fellowship's way.</p><p>Once every player has told us about an event and helped solve someone else's event, the fellowship arrives at their destination. So throughout a Journey, each player will create one scene, and help to resolve one scene. The first player to set a scene will also be the last player to resolve a scene. If a scene leads to combat or some other obstacle that the whole party participates in, that still counts as one player resolving the scene - the player who decided to solve it that way counts as the one who resolved it.</p><p>After every event has been resolved, you make it to your destination.</p><h3>A Little Downtime</h3><p>Downtime is a story you tell when the players spend some time in a city or other large civilization, usually with their own goals for what they want to accomplish while they are there. Downtime usually happens when you take the time to <em>Recover</em>, which the fellowship will need to do regularly.</p><p>When you spend some downtime in a city or village, each player tells us one thing their character did there, starting with whoever you like. The Overlord will ask you about it, such as \"who else was with you?\" or \"what made it harder than you expected?\" or \"someone in town didn't like that much, who was it?\"</p><p>After a player finishes their thing, another player gets to do a thing. Choose who goes next however you like - the previous player can choose, or someone can volunteer to go next, or you can just go around the table. This process repeats until everyone has done everything they want to do here, or something happens that forces everyone to move on with their quest.</p><p>During this montage, the Overlord will also take turns, describing what the Overlord is up to while the players are busy in town, which usually advances their</p><p>plans. The longer the players spend in Downtime before moving on, the more turns the Overlord gets to make preparations of their own. It is unwise to waste time while the world is ending.</p><h3>A Proper Challenge</h3><p>Challenges are the story of earning something worthwhile. When the fellowship sets a short-term goal, the story that tells their tale to achieve it is the Challenge. While Downtime and Journeys give each player a turn to set one scene, do a thing, and move on, Challenges don't work like that. Challenges are cooperative. Everyone works together in every scene, and you keep setting new scenes until the Challenge has been overcome.</p><p>Most of the time, a Challenge will come from trying to earn Fellowship. When you come to a community, they will have some trouble, usually caused by the Overlord, that must be resolved. The Challenge will be to figure out how to resolve it, and then working to do so.</p><p>The first scene of a Challenge, after you've figured out what the problem is, will almost always be spent making a plan. You need to know what you want to do and how you're going to do it, and then put the plan in motion. The next scene will be wherever the plan starts, or getting everything you need for it, and each scene after will flow from there.</p><p>A Challenge lasts for as many scenes as it takes until the fellowship succeeds, or their goal becomes unattainable. They should never give up on a challenge once they begin to pursue it without good reason.</p><p>A Set Piece is always a Challenge, no matter when or how you face it.</p><h3>The Showdown</h3><p>A Showdown is an interruption. It doesn't matter what story you were in the middle of. When the Overlord or one of their Generals suddenly makes an appearance, or when you stumble upon a Source of Power, they take over the plot. Whatever direction the story was going, it's been forced in a new direction now, and this new threat is at the center of it.</p><p>The Showdown always begins with the new threat asserting itself. The Overlord or their General makes a show of power, the story twists and changes, and the fellowship has to drop everything to face this new challenge. When you find a Source of Power, it should be equally dangerous and dramatic, even if the Overlord or their Generals aren't present to stop you.</p><p>After the threat has made a show of force, it is time to rumble. The fellowship is immediately placed in danger and must take action right now. The Showdown should be a long, extended, dramatic scene, with lots of danger. It is less of a Story and more of a scene that will not end until the threat is vanquished, or the fellowship is forced to retreat. A Showdown should keep the players moving, with</p><p>lots of things happening, and the Overlord should be ramping up the danger constantly until a conclusion is reached. Showdowns are your boss fights, and threats will be pouring out of the woodwork.</p><p>If a Showdown isn't dangerous, climactic, and dramatic, it isn't a Showdown.</p><h2>Agendas, Principles, and Moves</h2><p>While the Scene system sets up an outline for how the game flows, the actual rules for how to play Fellowship are found in three separate (but equally important) segments - your Agendas, your Principles, and your Moves.</p><p>If you are a member of the fellowship, your Agendas, Principles, and Moves are found in chapters 2 and 3. Everyone has the Agendas, Principles, and Moves found in chapter 2, but the Agendas and Moves found in chapter 3 will be unique to each player.</p><p>If you are the Overlord, your Agendas, Principles, and Moves are found in chapter 6. You will not use any of the Agendas, Principles, or Moves from chapters 2 and 3 .</p><p>Your Agendas are your guidelines. When you do not know what your character should do next, look to your guidelines for ideas.</p><p>Your Principles are your rules. During play, you should always follow your Principles. Do not break these rules.</p><p>Your Moves are what you actually do during the game. Within each Scene, everyone will say what their character is doing, and whenever they do something that triggers a Move, that player makes that Move, with everything it entails.</p><p>Some Moves will just do something. For example, the <em>Forge a Bond</em> Move has the trigger \"When you bond with someone over something you did or shared together.\" So when your character shares a moment with another character in the game, you trigger that Move, which tells you to write down a Bond with them. That just happens whenever you meet the trigger during play.</p><p>Some Moves will require you to roll, and the result of your roll determines how well it goes. For example, the Move <em>Get Away</em> tells you to roll +Grace when you meet the trigger.</p><p>Whenever a Move tells you to roll, you roll two six sided dice, and add the bonus listed by the Move.</p><p>So when you <em>Get Away</em>, you roll two dice and add your Grace modifier to the roll, which will be between -1 and +3. The higher your modifier, the better your chances of success.</p><p>Every Move that requires a roll has three different outcomes. On a 10 or higher, usually written as <strong>10+</strong>, you succeed, and get everything you wanted out of your Move. The Move will tell you specifically what happens in that case.</p><p>If your result is 7, 8, or 9, usually written as <strong>7-9</strong>, then you still succeed, but something usually goes wrong - you need to pay a price. Many Moves will tell you what happens, but if they do not, you may tell us the price you pay for success.</p><p>If your result is a 6 or less, usually written as 6-, then the Overlord gets to make a Cut against you! Some Moves will tell you what happens on a 6 or less, but most of them will not. In nearly all cases, the Overlord making a Cut against you is enough.</p><p>Some Moves may also have results written for a <strong>7+</strong> or a <strong>9-</strong>. The <strong>7+</strong> results happen if your die result is 7 or higher, and the <strong>9-</strong> results happen if your die result is 9 or less. This will create an overlap, where you do both results on a 7, 8, or 9.</p><p>Your Moves are your primary means of interacting with the world during the game, and whenever something is in doubt, always consult your Moves to see how you should resolve it. If you do not know which Move to use, you can always try to <em>Overcome</em> the threat or <em>Get Away</em> from the situation.</p><p>If none of your Moves fit what you want to do, and there is nothing you need to <em>Overcome</em> or <em>Get Away</em> from, then you just succeed. There is no reason to roll for something trivial or safe, you just do it.</p>"

        "content": "<h2>Fellowship Rules</h2><p>When you are playing as a member of the <em>Fellowship</em>, your job is to attempt to save the world, by whatever means you think is best. During play, you have some rules you must stick to - your Agendas, your Principles, and your Moves.</p><p>Your Agendas are what you need to be doing. If you're ever at a loss for what to do next, check your Agendas for ideas. Each member of the <em>Fellowship</em> has an additional Agenda from their playbook - make sure you follow that too. Your Agendas are no small thing, easily ignored - your hero has a burden, and they must carry that weight. Do not ignore your Agendas.</p><p>Your Principles are the hard and fast rules you must follow. Do not break them. If you make a mistake and break or ignore one of your Principles, just keep playing. Do better next time. But never break them on purpose.</p><p>Your Moves are what the dice are on the table for. When you play as a member of the <em>Fellowship</em>, they can do just about anything you want them to, at any time, as long as you have the <strong>Spotlight</strong> and follow your Principles. However, when you take an action that triggers one of your Moves, you must follow that Move to see what happens next.</p><p>In most cases, triggering a Move means you need to roll two six-sided dice, then add an appropriate stat to it. This will be abbreviated as \"roll +Blood,\" for instance, when you need to roll two dice, add them together, then add your Blood stat to the total. Then, consult the move to see what happens.</p><p>When you get a 10 or higher, you get a very good result. If you get a <strong>7-9</strong>, you succeed, but at some kind of cost or downside. <strong>On a 6-,</strong> you get a negative outcome - something happens, the scene changes and things keep moving, but it isn't in the way you wanted it to go. Most moves will tell you specifically what happens in certain dice ranges. Follow what the move says.</p><h2>Fellowship Agendas</h2><p>Your Agendas are your guideline for good play. When you don't know what to do next, consult your Agenda.</p><ul><li><strong>Improve The World Around You</strong></li><li><strong>Tell Us Of Your People</strong></li><li><strong>Be Brave, Take Risks</strong></li><li><strong>Keep Your Own Agenda</strong></li><li><strong>Improve The World Around You</strong></li></ul><p>The <em>Fellowship</em> was formed to save this world. Do what you can with what you have, in the way that you think works best. As long as you do what you feel is right, you are playing correctly. If the other players disagree with your methods, that's fine. They aren't you. Improve the world in the way you want it to be improved, and stick to your guns on it.</p><p>This doesn't mean you have to be a stubborn mule about everything, but it also means you shouldn't be a doormat either. Negotiate with the other members of the fellowship, and compromise when you must. You're a team. Act like it.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell Us Of Your People</strong></li></ul><p>No one knows your people better than you do. You are the arbiter of your people's lore and their place in this world. When you play as the Elf, you are speaking on behalf of all <strong>Elves</strong>. You are their champion, their spokesperson, the one they sent when the world was in peril. Represent them. Let us know about them, and bring your people's interests with you wherever you go. Do not forget where you came from, hero.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Brave, Take Risks</strong></li></ul><p>This is not supposed to be a boring adventure. It will be dangerous. Things could go very, very wrong, and you could get very, very hurt. But do not be afraid of the consequences. Do dangerous things. Do crazy things. Take risks, and deal with the fallout. Your hero is ultimately imaginary - do not be afraid to let them suffer for the sake of making your story more interesting. And who knows - maybe your reckless bravery will pay off, and then you'll look super cool for having done the impossible. If you don't get a little banged up, you're not trying hard enough to save the world.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep Your Own Agenda</strong></li></ul><p>Each of the heroes in the fellowship has their own personal Agenda, advising you about how to play them best. Keep to it as best you can.</p><h2>Fellowship Principles</h2><p>Your Principles are the rules you must follow during play. Do not break them.</p><ul><li><strong>Be heroic.</strong></li><li><strong>Create solutions, not problems.</strong></li><li><strong>Address the characters, not the players.</strong></li><li><strong>Embrace the fantastic.</strong></li><li><strong>Make a move that follows.</strong></li><li><strong>Remind us of your moves.</strong></li><li><strong>Always ask questions. Always answer questions.</strong></li><li><strong>Begin and end with the fiction.</strong></li><li><strong>Don't steal the Spotlight...</strong></li><li><strong>...But shine on when you have it</strong></li><li><strong>Be heroic.</strong></li></ul><p>As the fellowship, you're here to save the day. If you want to play as some jerk ruining the world, play as the Overlord. If you're part of the fellowship, you have a duty to save this world, and you cannot go back on that. By signing onto the fellowship, you have signed away your chance to go back to a simple, safer life. You have given up that life. You are a hero now.</p><p>So be a hero. Do heroic things. Take heroic actions. Do the right thing, whatever you think that may be. The fellowship has a purpose, and it is your job to play to that purpose. Act like the heroes you are.</p><ul><li><strong>Create solutions, not problems.</strong></li></ul><p>The world is not doing so hot these days. The Overlord is causing all sorts of problems with their armies, and messing up all kinds of things along the way. There's plenty of bad going around already, so don't add more onto it. You're the good guys. It's your job to solve problems, help people, and save the world.</p><p>You don't need to come up with a solution for every single thing you face some things you may not be able to do anything about, and some threats may be better off ignored if you have something else you need to do more. You do not need to do everything alone, and you should not be afraid to call for help when you need it.</p><p>But at the end of the day, the fellowship should not be creating more problems for the world. Sometimes things will get worse, and sometimes they'll get worse because of something you did, but that isn't your goal. Don't create problems on purpose, and deal with as many problems as you can handle.</p><ul><li><strong>Address the characters, not the players.</strong></li></ul><p>Nothing takes your mind out of the game quicker than having all your friends call your <strong>Halfling</strong> \"Nate\" over and over again. That's <strong>Bungo Bullroarer</strong> to you, <strong>Thrór</strong>. Get to know everyone's character's names, and use them. Write their names down if you need to - you'll be writing them into your Bonds anyway, so that's a good place for it.</p><ul><li><strong>Embrace the fantastic.</strong></li></ul><p>The world is an exciting place, filled with bizarre and whimsical things. Run with it. If something sounds completely implausible, impossible, or stupid, ask yourself \"would the game be better if it <strong>WERE</strong> plausible?\" If you said \"yes,\" then make it so. This is a fantastic world, filled with the strange and mysterious. Don't hold yourself down with something as petty as \"real world physics\" or \"logic\" and especially not \"historical accuracy.\"</p><p>This is especially relevant when discussing the lore of your people. When playing as an Elf, you are the final arbiter on all things Elf. So go crazy! Your elves can be travelers from the future, sent back to the past to stop the overlord. Or they can be from magnificent cloud cities that float above the world. Or maybe <strong>Elves</strong> are the only things in all of creation that know how to swim, and the oceans and seas are barren of all life other than the elves and crabs. Embrace the fantastic.</p><ul><li><strong>Make a move that follows.</strong></li></ul><p>When you have the chance to use one of your Moves, make sure it makes sense in the current situation. You can only make a Move if you trigger it you cannot <em>Keep Them Busy</em> if you do not put yourself in their way or have something to distract them with. To use a move, first tell us what you're doing, and if it triggers a move, then roll that move. To do it, you must do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Remind us of your moves.</strong></li></ul><p>Everyone shares the same Basic Moves, but each hero has their own moves to call upon when they need them. You're responsible for keeping track of those moves. For example, if <strong>The Dwarf</strong> charges into a whole group of enemies, shield and hammer held high, we may think you want to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>, when you're actually trying to <em><strong>Clear the Path</strong></em>. Be clear on which move you're using when you trigger it, and let us know exactly what happens after you roll it. If the move has multiple choices for you to choose between, let us know both the ones you did pick, and the ones you did <strong>NOT</strong> pick, especially if there are consequences for not taking those choices.</p><ul><li><strong>Always ask questions. Always answer questions.</strong></li></ul><p>If you don't know something, ask. This doesn't apply to just the rules - if you want to know more about the <strong>Heir's</strong> character or their people, just ask them. If you want to know more about the current situation, just ask the Overlord (although they may ask you to *Look Closely). If you want to know more about someone, just ask their player (although you may need to *Speak Softly).</p><p>If someone asks you a question about your character or their people, answer it. If you don't know, make something up - you are the authority on all things <strong>Halfling</strong>, so act like it. Whatever you say goes. If you can't come up with something good, you can always ask the table for ideas, but you have final say on the truth of the matter.</p><ul><li><strong>Begin and end with the fiction.</strong></li></ul><p>Start a move with what triggered it, end the move with what it accomplished, and then figure out what happens from there. The fictional story you are all building together is the most important part of the game - it's why you're playing, in fact. The entire point of <em>Fellowship</em> is to have a fun adventure, and figure out how that adventure unfolds during play. Whenever you make a move, something should always change in the situation - figure out what's changed, and work with the new situation.</p><p>Always describe exactly what you're doing, and adapt to the changing world around you. Begin your moment in the <strong>Spotlight</strong> with what you are doing or you want to do, and end your moment in the <strong>Spotlight</strong> figuring out what changed. That is how you begin and end with the fiction, so the next person to get the <strong>Spotlight</strong> can begin with their own fiction more easily.</p><ul><li><strong>Don't steal the Spotlight...</strong></li></ul><p>When another player is taking action, let them do so. Don't interrupt, don't take over, don't get in their way, don't suggest ideas. If they don't know what to do or ask for help, then sure, you can make suggestions, give advice, and all that. But if they don't ask for help, don't give them any. Let them play their character, let them have their moment, let them do their own thing. Jumping in and taking someone else's moment is rude.</p><p>Caveat: If you notice someone hasn't had the <strong>Spotlight</strong> in a while, feel free to speak up, so we can get back to them at the first reasonable chance. It is important to never steal the <strong>Spotlight</strong>, but this assumes everyone has a fair chance to use it - if someone isn't getting their fair share of <strong>Spotlight</strong> time, or someone is getting too much <strong>Spotlight</strong> time, it's on everyone to make sure that gets fixed.</p><ul><li><strong>...But shine on when you have it</strong></li></ul><p>When you have the <strong>Spotlight</strong>, use it. Do something cool. Do something fun. Do something wild. It doesn't matter, so long as you do something. When you have the <strong>Spotlight</strong>, run with it.</p><h2>Basic Moves</h2><p>Your Moves are available to every member of the fellowship at all times. The Basic Moves will always require you to make a roll, and they will come up frequently when danger is present. The players will rely on these moves to solve problems right in front of them, letting them avoid danger, defeat enemies, learn more about the world around them, convince others to help them, plan ahead with all the information, or smooth out wrinkles in the journey ahead.</p><p>You can get a printable cheat sheet of the <em>Fellowship</em> Basic Moves here: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks\">http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks</a></p><h3>Finish Them</h3><p><strong>When you attempt to defeat an enemy you hold an Advantage over,</strong> tell us what you want to do to them and roll the appropriate stat.</p><p><strong>If you do not have an Advantage over them,</strong> you cannot attempt to Finish Them. An Advantage is something you can use to get the upper hand, such as teamwork, the element of surprise, or a moment of hesitation.</p><h4>What Is An Advantage?</h4><p>An Advantage is any means of fictional superiority you hold over someone else. <strong>When you do something that sounds like an Advantage,</strong> then you have an Advantage. <strong>If they are better than you,</strong> you do not have Advantage, and you will need to find a way to turn the tables if you want to Finish Them.</p><p>Some of your moves can be used to get an Advantage. <em>Keep Them Busy</em> and Bound In Service easily grant Advantages. Your Gear can sometimes grant you an Advantage through clever usage. But mostly, Advantages are found in the fiction, and gaining Advantage involves setting up a situation where you are clearly better than your foe.</p><h4>If you Finish Them by...</h4><p><strong>...trying to kill them,</strong> roll +Blood. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> they die by your hand.<br /><strong>...forcing them to retreat,</strong> roll +Courage. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> they back off. They won't be back any time soon.<br /><strong>...outsmarting, terrifying, or overwhelming them,</strong> roll +Grace. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> they admit defeat, and will not willingly challenge you again.<br /><strong>...disabling them or knocking them out,</strong> roll +Sense. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> they're physically incapacitated and unable to continue.<br /><strong>...showing them the error of their ways,</strong> roll +Wisdom. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> you <em>Forge a Bond</em> with them, and they cannot bring themselves to hurt you.</p><p><strong>On a 7-9,</strong> you deal damage to them and lose your Advantage over them.<br /><strong>If an ally was </strong><em><strong>Keeping Them Busy</strong></em><strong>,</strong> they aren't anymore.</p><p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> you lose the Advantage, and you must face retaliation.</p><p><strong>If you Finish Them using a weapon with Ammo,</strong> use 1 Ammo. <strong>If you have no Ammo,</strong> you cannot Finish Them with that weapon.</p><p><strong>If you have the Clumsy tag,</strong> you take -1 to Finish Them.</p><h4><em>Examples of When to Finish Them</em></h4><p>When you leap onto an enemy from behind, plunging your sword into them,* Finish Them with +Blood.</p><p><em>When you trade blows with them repeatedly until they can take no more,</em> Finish Them with +Courage (or +Iron).</p><p><em>When you fire a dozen arrows in an outline around your target,</em> trying to terrify them into submission, Finish Them with +Grace.</p><p><em>When you strike at their joints to disable them,</em> Finish Them with +Sense.</p><p><em>When you nurse them back to health after their grievous injuries,</em> Finish Them with +Wisdom.</p><h2>Overcome (Blood)</h2><p><strong>When you attempt to avoid, redirect, or prevent the harm something will cause,</strong> roll +Blood. You can <em>Overcome</em> any obstacle, threat, Cut, or Move made against you or an ally, if you are in a position to act against it and have the means to stop it.</p><p><strong>On a 10+,</strong> you stop the obstacle, threat, Cut, or Move from causing harm.<br /><strong>On a 7-9,</strong> choose one: You can pay a price to take the <strong>10+</strong> result, or you can create a temporary solution. A temporary solution will delay the threat, but when time is up, it'll be back in force - the Overlord will tell you when.</p><p>Overcoming harm with a weapon does not cost Ammo.</p><h3><em>Examples of When to Overcome</em></h3><p><em>The warrior's blade comes slamming down and you raise your spear to deflect it.</em> Roll to Overcome.</p><p><em>The floor suddenly opens up beneath you - a Pit trap! When you try to leap aside,</em> roll to Overcome.</p><p><em>A wild boar charges your friend, so you try to tackle it away!</em> Roll to Overcome.</p><h2>Keep Them Busy (Courage)</h2><p><strong>When you act as a distraction or buy some time,</strong> tell us how and roll +Courage.</p><p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> you buy some time, and their attention is all on you, for now.<br /><strong>On a 9-,</strong> they will retaliate against you when time is up.<br /><strong>While you Keep Them Busy,</strong> you create an Advantage for your allies.<br /><strong>If you Keep Them Busy using a weapon with Ammo,</strong> use 1 Ammo. <strong>If you have no Ammo,</strong> you cannot Keep Them Busy with that weapon.</p><p><strong>If you have the Clumsy tag,</strong> you take -1 to Keep Them Busy.</p><h3><em>Examples of When to Keep Them Busy</em></h3><p><em>You stand in the doorway, holding the missing door as a shield while the enemies try to slam through you.</em> Roll to Keep Them Busy.</p><p><em>Your friend tries to sneak past the guard, so you go up and inform them of an 'incident' you 'saw' down the road.</em> Roll to Keep Them Busy.</p><p><em>The zombie claws at your buddy's feet up on the ledge, trying to grab him, so you drop down behind the zombie and put it in a Full Nelson.</em> Roll to Keep Them Busy.</p><h2>Get Away (Grace)</h2><p><strong>When you need to get somewhere out of reach or out of sight,</strong> tell us where you're going and roll +Grace. <strong>If you have the Clumsy tag,</strong> you take -1 to Get Away. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> choose two. <strong>On a 7-9,</strong> choose one:</p><ul><li>You get there quickly, avoiding any harm along the way.</li><li>You get there quietly, drawing no attention.</li><li>You grab someone nearby and bring them along with you.</li></ul><h3><em>Examples of When to Get Away</em></h3><p><em>You leap over, under, and through the buzz saws of the trapped hallway.</em> Roll to Get Away.</p><p><em>The troll reaches at you, up on the cliff face, and you attempt to climb higher, up, away, out of its reach.</em> Roll to Get Away.</p><p><em>You see the guards approaching, and duck behind a corner, hoping to avoid being seen.</em> Roll to Get Away.</p><h2>Look Closely (Sense)</h2><p><strong>When you closely examine a situation or a location,</strong> roll +Sense.<br /><strong>On a 7+,</strong> ask three questions from the list. Anyone can answer, but the Overlord has the final say.</p><p><strong>On a 9-,</strong> you find one of those answers the hard way.<br /><strong>On a 6-,</strong> you may only ask one question.</p><ul><li>What is going on here? What do my senses tell me?</li><li>Is something hidden or out of place? If so, what looks suspicious?</li><li>Tell me about ______ . How could it hurt me? How could it help me?</li><li>Tell me about ______ . What are they doing? What will they do next?</li><li>What will happen if I ______ ?</li></ul><h3><em>Examples of When to Look Closely</em></h3><p><em>You scope out the area, trying to find out the best way to ambush the coming raiders.</em> Roll to Look Closely.</p><p><em>The political council guards their words closely, eyeing each other with suspicion, rarely letting anyone get a word in edgewise. Trying to figure out who stands for what is difficult.</em> Roll to Look Closely.</p><p><em>You come across a fight - a bunch of dock workers are slugging it out with the postal service. You have no idea what's going on down there.</em> Roll to Look Closely.</p><h2>Speak Softly (Wisdom)</h2><p><strong>When you have a quiet chat with someone,</strong> you may roll +Wisdom.<br />Then, ask three questions from the list.<br /><strong>On a 10+,</strong> they must answer each question honestly.<br /><strong>On a 9-,</strong> one of their answers is not helpful. Either they refuse to answer or they reveal a terrible truth you didn't want to hear, their choice.</p><p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> one of their other answers is false. You won't be told which.</p><ul><li>What can they tell us about ______ ?</li><li>What were they doing, and what are they going to do next?</li><li>What should I be wary of when dealing with them?</li><li>What do they want, and how could we help them get it?</li><li>What would they have us do next?</li></ul><h3><em>Examples of When to Speak Softly</em></h3><p><em>You raise your hands up, offering to parley. The enemy has you at their mercy they grant your request.</em> Roll to Speak Softly.</p><p><em>You sit at the counter, asking the barkeep about the town.</em> Roll to Speak Softly.<br /><em>You and the gremlin breathe a sigh of relief, having narrowly escaped the raft plummeting over the waterfall. But now you're stuck together on this tiny rock, at least for a little while, with nothing but each other for company.</em> Roll to Speak Softly.</p><p>The Elf has been really cagey lately, and you want to put a stop to it, right now. You pull them aside, say \"Listen, lad, we're in this together, so you need to be honest with the rest o' us here.\" Roll to Speak Softly with them.</p><p>When rolling a 6- on Speak Softly, one of their answers is incorrect. However, this does not need to be a lie. One of their answers is just false.</p><p>Maybe they just say what they think you want to hear.<br />Maybe they don't want you to know, and are lying to deceive you.<br />Maybe they are trying to protect you from the truth.<br />Maybe they can't tell you - someone's keeping them quiet.<br />Or maybe they don't know the truth, and their answer is a guess.</p><p>Just because you rolled a 6- does not mean the person you're talking to hates you, is secretly evil, or wants the fellowship to fail. It just means they told you some bad information.</p><h2>Talk Sense (Grace or Sense or (Wisdom)</h2><p><strong>When you speak with conviction and ask someone for help,</strong> tell us what you want from them and why they should help you. <strong>If they're willing to listen,</strong> roll.</p><p><strong>When you detail your plan and their place in it,</strong> roll +Sense.<br /><strong>When you appeal to their emotions or their desires,</strong> roll +Wisdom.<br /><strong>When you impress, dazzle, or trick them,</strong> roll +Grace.</p><p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> they do as you ask, to the best of their ability.<br /><strong>On a 9-,</strong> you owe them a favor. The more you ask of them, the more they'll ask of you, and they can cash in at any time - even right now, before they do as you ask.</p><p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> they choose one:</p><ul><li>The favor you must do for them is expensive, difficult, or demeaning.</li><li>They cannot do what you ask of them, and will tell you why.</li></ul><h3><em>Examples of When to Talk Sense</em></h3><p>*The politician's plan will not appease the Overlord. You know this, but the politician says there is no better way. When you try to convince him to stand and fight, providing the logistics behind your assured victory, Talk Sense with +Sense.</p><p><em>While the troll is stirring their stew, ready to drop in the Dwarf for their meal, you tell them how nasty dwarves taste, but also, how delicious sheep are, and you know just where some nearby sheep are, too!</em> Roll to Talk Sense with +Wisdom.</p><p><em>There is no rational way you could ever convince this man that what you're doing is good for him, or his family. So you lie. You lie a LOT.</em> Roll to Talk Sense with +Grace.</p><h2>When To Use The Basic Moves</h2><p>The Basic Moves are fairly straightforward, but not everything about them is immediately apparent just from their triggers and results. If you have any questions about which Basic Move to use when, this is where to look.</p><p><em><strong>Look Closely</strong></em> and <em><strong>Speak Softly</strong></em> are both used when you need more information. The main thing to note is that both Moves take time - you can't <em>Look Closely</em> with just a glance, it takes more than that. <em>Speak Softly</em> also takes time, but you won't usually be pressed for time when you're having a friendly chat, so that won't come up as often. It is important to note that these Moves <em>can</em> be used on other members of the fellowship, not just outsiders.</p><p>Each of the other Basic Moves are used to solve problems or avoid danger. To more closely look at their differences, let's use an example. There is a pair of spear wielding warriors guarding a hallway.</p><p><strong>When a warrior attempts to stab you,</strong> you need to <em><strong>Overcome</strong></em> it to avoid harm, by blocking it, or dodging it, or doing something else. <em>Overcome</em> is used only reactively, in response to sudden danger.</p><p><strong>When you attempt to sneak or run past them,</strong> you'll need to <em><strong>Get Away</strong></em>. <em>Get Away</em> is used to escape from or avoid danger, and is ideal for escaping from situations you don't need to fix or fight through.</p><p><strong>When you try to distract them with your words or your actions,</strong> you'll need to <em><strong>Keep Them Busy</strong></em>. <em>Keep Them Busy</em> is used to stall or stop harm proactively, but doesn't solve the problem itself. The guards are still there, and still stopping you, but now they're not paying attention to anyone else.</p><p><strong>When you try to fight someone when you don't have Advantage,</strong> you roll to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>.</p><p><strong>When you try to convince them to let you through,</strong> you'll need to <em><strong>Talk Sense</strong></em>. You <em>Talk Sense</em> to get someone to do something for you, like let you pass, help you out, or do you a favor.</p><p><strong>When you try to defeat them for good, by any means you can think of,</strong> roll to <em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em>. <em>Finish Them</em> can use any stat and solve any problem, but which stat you roll depends on what you want to happen to them. This Move is the hardest of the Basic Moves to trigger, but also the strongest. You cannot attempt to <em>Finish Them</em> without holding an Advantage over them.</p><h2>Special Moves</h2><h3>Command Lore</h3><p><strong>When someone asks something about your character or your people,</strong> tell them. <strong>When you ask about another character or their people,</strong> they will tell you the answer. <strong>When you ask about the Overlord,</strong> they alone may choose not to answer.</p><h3>Earning Fellowship</h3><p>Fellowship is earned through action. <strong>When you have spent some time getting a feel for a community and speaking with the people in it,</strong> the Overlord will tell you what this community needs, what they are lacking, or how the Overlord has harmed them. <strong>If you can solve this problem,</strong> you will earn their respect, their admiration, and their Fellowship.</p><p><strong>When you have earned Fellowship with a community, no matter how you earned it,</strong> the Overlord will ask you to pick one of a Fellowship Moves. The player who picks the Move is either the one most aligned to the community or the one who played the largest role in earning their Fellowship. The Move you pick applies so long as you keep Fellowship with that community. Fellowship is lost if you betray them, or if you revoke their Fellowship for some reason, or if the Overlord destroys the community.</p><h3>Forge a Bond</h3><p><strong>When you bond with someone over something you did or shared together,</strong> record a new Bond with them on your sheet, describing the connection you two now hold. A Bond is a single sentence describing how you feel about them or what you two have done together. <strong>If you already had a Bond with them,</strong> you can add another Bond, or rewrite an existing one. You can never have more than three Bonds with someone.</p><p><strong>If you </strong><em><strong>Forge a Bond</strong></em><strong> with someone outside the fellowship, they will join your cause as a Companion,</strong> so long as the Bond holds. You can always give something Precious to someone to immediately <em>Forge a Bond</em> with them.</p><p><em>A note on Forging Bonds:</em> Forging Bonds is something you should do constantly. Whenever two players do something cool or touching together, they should <em>Forge a Bond</em>. When you make a new friend, <em>Forge a Bond</em>. When you help an enemy out, <em>Forge a Bond</em>. Bonds are super easy to make and the fellowship should be making new ones constantly.</p><h3>The Bonds That Bind Us</h3><p><strong>When two or more players who have Bonds with each other work together side by side,</strong> they roll with Hope. <strong>When one of them must pay a price,</strong> another may choose to pay that price instead.</p><p><em>A note on the Bonds That Bind Us:</em> Teamwork is a fairly vague notion, but the intent is that you two have to be working closely together to use this Move. It is primarily intended to be used when you are all doing the same thing (everyone works together to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>, or two players coordinate an ambush to <em>Finish Them</em> together), so one player rolls with Hope instead of everyone rolling separately. However, it doesn't need to be that - any time two players are working closely alongside one another towards the same goal, they may roll with Hope and pay each others' prices.</p><h3>The Bonds Chat Break Us</h3><p><strong>When your actions harm an ally,</strong> erase one of your Bonds with them immediately. <strong>When you have no Bonds with a member of the fellowship,</strong> you cannot work alongside them without getting in each others' way, and you both roll with Despair when working together.</p><h3>Bound in Service</h3><p><strong>When you call upon a Companion for help,</strong> you may damage one of their stats to create an Advantage related to that stat. <strong>If all of a Companion's stats are damaged and they'd take further damage,</strong> lose a Bond with them. <strong>When no one has Bonds with a Companion,</strong> they leave the fellowship.</p><h3>Heart of Fire</h3><p><strong>When you hold a Bond with the Overlord,</strong> they do not become your Companion, but you still hold sway over them. You may erase that Bond with them at any time to buy yourself reprieve. <strong>Choose one:</strong> They will show you mercy, tell you something valuable, or ignore you for the time being.</p><h3>Heart of Iron</h3><p><strong>When you would make a Move against the Overlord,</strong> you may automatically fail the roll to erase one of their Bonds with you. <strong>If you do,</strong> they steal the Spotlight and <em>Twist The Knife</em> against you, but they will not be able to react to anything the rest of the fellowship does while they hurt you.</p><h3>Day a Price</h3><p><strong>When a Move tells you to pay a price,</strong> tell us what it costs you. A price you pay can be in the form of taking damage, or losing some equipment, or Using some equipment, or losing an Advantage, or suffering a setback of some kind. Whatever the cost, you must pay that price immediately before, during, or after the Move you paid for.</p><h3>Fill Your Belly</h3><p>Food is important in <em>Fellowship</em>. <strong>When you are between scenes,</strong> you may Use Food to heal one damage. <strong>When you share a meal with friends,</strong> one person may heal an extra point of damage.</p><p><em>A note on Filling Your Bellies:</em> You don't need to share with the fellowship to get the bonus healing, but you do need to spend 1 Food per person eating. No matter how many share a meal, there is only one extra point of healing.</p><h3>End of Session</h3><p><strong>At the end of a Session (or the beginning of the next, if you forgot about it),</strong> the fellowship answers these three questions:</p><ul><li>Did we save or protect a community in need?</li><li>Did we strike a blow against the Overlord and their minions?</li><li>Did we learn more about the world and its peoples?</li></ul><p><strong>For each \"yes\" answer,</strong> the group chooses one of the following options. You may choose an option more than once.</p><ul><li>Each player refreshes one piece of their Gear to its full value.</li><li>Each player chooses one stat to Heal. It does not have to be theirs.</li><li>The fellowship and the Overlord each choose one player to level up. You cannot be chosen to level up if you are the highest level player or you have already been chosen to level up. If at least two players are tied for highest level, anyone can level up. Nobody actually levels up until all choices on who levels up have been made.</li></ul><h3>Level Up</h3><p><strong>When you Level Up,</strong> increase your level by 1, then choose one option from your playbook's Advancement list. Mark off the option you chose - you can never take it again.</p><h3>Recover</h3><p><strong>When you spend a week in a place of safety,</strong> you can Recover. Remove all damage from all of your stats, and reset all of your Gear to their starting values. A place you have Fellowship with is always a place of safety.</p><p><strong>If the Overlord has any damage,</strong> they heal one damage now. <strong>While you Recover,</strong> the Overlord marches on - they now Advance their Plans, and the fellowship can do nothing about it.</p><h3>Damage and Healing</h3><p><strong>When you take damage, either by making a Move or paying a price,</strong> choose a stat and mark it. Sometimes you will not get a choice, and a stat will be damaged for you. <strong>While a stat is damaged,</strong> you are in Despair whenever you roll that stat. <strong>When an enemy's stat or a Companion's stat is damaged,</strong> they cannot use it.</p><p>You cannot mark a stat that has already been marked. <strong>When you heal,</strong> remove a mark from one of your stats. <strong>When you take damage while all of your stats are already marked,</strong> you get Taken Out.</p><h3>Taken Out</h3><p><strong>When all of your stats are damaged and you take further damage,</strong> you are Taken Out, and no longer able to help out for the rest of the scene. Tell us how you got Taken Out. What happened to you? What is going to happen to you next? Can the fellowship save you from your fate? If so, how?</p><p><strong>If you decide you are dying,</strong> describe Death for us. As a hero, your soul is valuable - what does Death offer you in exchange for your soul? Do you take their offer? If you do, you are most certainly dead. <strong>If you die,</strong> you can rejoin the game at level 1 next session, using the same playbook or a new one.</p><p><strong>If you are Taken Out in the presence of the Overlord,</strong> they will make you <em>An Offer You Can't Refuse</em>. They may ask for your services, for something you hold, or for the end of your life. You can take it or leave it, but <strong>if you refuse,</strong> you must roll + Courage.</p><p><strong>If you survive being Taken Out,</strong> you will be able to continue play starting with the next scene, with all of your stats still damaged.</p><h3>Sharing Moves</h3><p><strong>When an Advancement option tells you to share a Move,</strong> choose a Move you already know. The player giving the Move always chooses which Move is shared. The player you are sharing with gains that Move, and can use it from now on. They write it onto their playbook, and it is now their Move too. You cannot share a Move you do not know, even if it is on your playbook. You cannot share a Move that says it cannot be shared. You cannot share a Move from a Destiny playbook or from a Powerful playbook.</p><h3>Taking Moves</h3><p><strong>When you are told to take a Move,</strong> you cannot take a Move that cannot be shared, and you cannot take a Destiny Move. <strong>When you take a Move,</strong> it doesn't need to be a Move someone else already knows, and you do not need permission.</p><h2>Primary Stats</h2><p>Players in <em>Fellowship</em> have five statistics: Blood, Courage, Sense, Grace, Wisdom. Your stats represent your characters' proficiencies and their spirit. Each stat will have a number attached to it, which is your bonus whenever a Move tells you to roll that stat. For example, if you have Blood +2, you roll at +2 when you try to <em>Overcome</em> something.</p><p>After you choose your playbook, you will assign the following numbers to your five stats: +2, +2, +1, +0, -1. Each playbook will tell you which stat to put the first +2 into, but you may assign the other four stats however you wish.</p><p>Higher numbers are better than low numbers, and each hero will use some stats more than others. Be sure to read over your playbook before making a final decision on where your stats go, and assign your stats based on which Basic Moves you want to use the most. In addition to the Basic Moves listed, each stat is used in the <em>Finish Them</em> Basic Move.</p><p><strong>Blood:</strong> Your boiling veins, your burning passion, your bloodline, your burning need to protect your friends and family. Blood means power, ferocity, loyalty, rage, and passion. Blood is used for feats of physical strength, combat prowess, and your capacity to protect yourself and others. It is used in the Basic Move <em>Overcome</em>.</p><p><strong>Courage:</strong> Your inner strength, your force of will, your tenacity, your brilliant shining soul. Courage determines your ability to stand proud, face death in the eye, and keep on trucking, no matter how bad things get. Courage is used to stand up for what matters and inspire others to your cause. It is used in the Basic Move <em>Keep Them Busy</em>.</p><p><strong>Grace:</strong> Your style, your talent, your artistry, your beauty. Grace is all about looking good, being cool, and acting with skill and agility. Grace is used to perform spectacular acts, trick others, avoid danger, and show off. It is used in the Basic Moves <em>Get Away</em> and <em>Talk Sense</em>.</p><p><strong>Sense:</strong> Your wits, your etiquette, your logical ability, your eyes and ears. Sense is about keeping track of the world around you, analyzing it in a logical and sensible manner, and working from a well-reasoned perspective. Sense is used to discern the realities all around you, keeping you informed in all situations. It is used in the Basic Moves <em>Look Closely</em> and <em>Talk Sense</em>.</p><p><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Your knowledge, your experience, your cultural relations, your tact and kindness. Wisdom is all about doing the right thing, at the right time, in the right way, and knowing that you did good, kid. Wisdom is used to make friends, tell us what's what, and get what you want without being rude about it. It is used in the Basic Moves <em>Speak Softly</em> and <em>Talk Sense</em>.</p><h2>Hope, Despair, and Bonds</h2><p>You always have all of the main five stats, but there are some stats that are temporary. You gain them from certain Moves or in certain situations, and they last until you're told otherwise. These temporary stats are Hope, Despair, and most importantly, Bonds.</p><p><strong>Hope:</strong> When you are filled with Hope, instead of rolling two six sided dice, roll three and take the highest two dice as your final roll.</p><p><strong>Despair:</strong> When you are filled with Despair, instead of rolling two six sided dice, roll three and take the lowest two dice as your final roll. Companions who are in Despair cannot use their Moves, cannot take damage for you, and cannot help you.</p><p>Hope and Despair do not \"stack.\" That is, if you have Hope from two different sources, you still only roll three dice and keep the best two.</p><p>Hope and Despair also cancel each other out. If you have both Hope and Despair at the same time, you roll normally. This is true even if you have double Hope and triple Despair, because again, they do not stack.</p><p><strong>Bonds:</strong> Bonds are a description of your relationship with another player, a Companion, or an enemy. Bonds can be one to three sentences long. When you gain a Bond, using the <em>Forge a Bond</em> Move, it starts at only a single sentence, describing an experience you two have shared or the relationship you two have. If you <em>Forge a Bond</em> with someone you already have a Bond with, you can add an additional sentence, describing your relationship in further depth, or you can rewrite an existing sentence to better suit your new relationship. Each sentence is one Bond, and you can have a maximum of three Bonds with a single person.</p><p>Teamwork is an extremely important part of <em>Fellowship</em>, and the Bonds you have with your allies will support and protect you along your journey. Bonds with the other players will bind you together and fill you with Hope, and forming Bonds with people outside the fellowship will help define their role in the story, bring them to your cause, and otherwise flesh out your place in the world.</p><p>Bonds with Companions are used to measure how much they respect you and how faithfully they follow you. When a Companion is damaged while they have no other stats to take the hit, someone loses a Bond with them. If no one has any more Bonds with a Companion, they will leave you. If you intentionally harm your Companions, your Bonds will break, with serious consequences.</p><p>Bonds with enemies are the opposite. Bonds you have with the enemy can fill you with Despair, or be used to put you in a bad spot, or even dissolve your other Bonds. You will not usually gain Bonds with the enemy willingly - the Overlord and their minions will create Bonds with you, and they are one of the Overlord's main tools for getting underneath the fellowship's skin and causing dissent among the ranks.</p><p>Bonds with the enemy are extremely dangerous, but they are a known danger - like all Bonds, they are recorded directly on your character sheet. You know your own weaknesses, after all, and you can try to plan around them. For more details on how Bonds with the enemy work, see the Overlord's playbook in chapter 6.</p><h2>Companions</h2><p>Companions are the friends and allies you recruit along your journey. They are not necessarily people - mounts you can ride, animals you have trained, and vehicles you can pilot also use the Companion rules.</p><p>A Companion is an extension of your character sheet. While you have them, all of their stats are available to you. You can have them use one of their stats to help you by damaging that stat. For example, the Elven Archer has the stat \"Perfect Shot.\" You can damage that stat at any time to have them do a single thing that could help you by taking a perfect shot, such as tripping up a charging enemy, or blocking an attack on you, or taking out an enemy sniper, etc.</p><p><strong>When you are working alongside a Companion you have Bonds with,</strong> you can always have them take damage in your place, when you would take damage. <strong>If a Companion takes damage when all their stats are already damaged,</strong> you must erase one Bond with them.</p><p><strong>If you no longer have any Bonds with a Companion,</strong> they leave your services. This could be from their death, or they give up the journey due to the danger, or they no longer want anything to do with you. Your Bonds with them are the only thing holding them to this journey.</p><p>Companions who are in Despair cannot use their Moves, cannot take damage for you, and cannot help you. Only the heroes of the fellowship can fight through true Despair. Companions are not put in Despair by having their stats damaged, only from other effects that say so.</p><p>Every playbook has the option to have some Companions as part of their Gear. Companions are slightly different from ordinary Gear in that they can become lost forever. <strong>When you lose all Bonds with a Companion in your Gear,</strong> you have a choice to make the next time you <em>Recover</em>. You can gain a new Companion with the same abilities, OR get a new Companion from the same Gear option.</p><p>For example, Ardric the Dwarf has a Dwarven Gunner Companion, who dies tragically during the adventure. The specific Gear option that gave him a Gunner Companion reads \"A dwarven gunner or blacksmith. You have one Bond with them.\" When Ardric <em>Recovers</em>, he can replace the gunner with another gunner, or he can get a blacksmith to join instead. No matter which he picks, he has only one Bond with the new recruit.</p><h2>Gear</h2><p>Your Gear is that equipment that is vital to the core of your character, and you choose a bunch of Gear during character creation.</p><p><strong>Your Gear is separate from just \"the stuff you have.\"</strong><br /><strong>Your Gear is not the same thing as \"the things you carry with you.\"</strong></p><p>Every time you <em>Recover</em>, your Gear also recovers, and returns to how it was back when you got it. You get all your Uses back for used up Gear, you recover any damaged or lost Gear, and any Companions who are part of your Gear get healed up, return to you, or replaced. This only happens with your Gear: anything else you pick up along your journey does not <em>Recover</em>.</p><p>For example, a player finds some Elven Bread (4 Uses, Food). If you <em>Recover</em> after eating 2 uses of your bread, you still only have 2 uses remaining. The bread is not part of your Gear, and it does not recover with your Gear, and it must be recorded separately. However, the <em>Elven Bread</em> that The Elf gets from their starting Gear will return to 4 Uses when you <em>Recover</em>, because that bread is part of their Gear, and is a part of what it means to be The Elf.</p><h2>Tags</h2><p>Tags are shorthand rules attached to items or equipment, and they grant certain benefits or penalties when they come up. Tags are a short-hand method for letting you know how something works at a glance.</p><h3>Range Tags</h3><p>Range tags let you know at what range a weapon or attack is useful. You cannot use a weapon outside its Range.</p><p><strong>Melee:</strong> Melee weapons require you to get up close and personal. Axes, daggers, swords, anything you hit a guy with directly.</p><p><strong>Ranged:</strong> Ranged weapons let you shoot someone from a safe distance. They are difficult to use safely in Melee range, but useful for keeping enemies from getting into Melee range in the first place. Ranged weapons include slings, bows, guns, and thrown weapons, like javelins or knives or throwing axes.</p><p><strong>Area:</strong> Area weapons hit a large area, and are useful for fighting many enemies at once. Area weapons are usually magical or explosive in nature, such as lightning bolts or dynamite. Weapons with the Dangerous tag also have the Area tag if no other range is listed.</p><h3>Item Tags</h3><p>Item tags can go on anything, and they describe the properties of an item. They are truths about the item you hold in your hands.</p><p><strong>Burning:</strong> <em>Burning</em> weapons start fires. This tag is only applied to weapons and attacks, like Piercing and Necrotic. <em>Burning</em> attacks ignite their targets on fire with each hit, and can be used to easily create fire wherever you need it. They have no additional effect on enemies that cannot be ignited, such as enemies of rock or water, and deal no damage at all to anyone who is fireproof.</p><p><strong>Clumsy:</strong> Clumsy weapons or items are weird and difficult to wield, and Clumsy armor is hard to move in. <strong>When you are using a Clumsy item,</strong> you take -1 to <em>Keep Them Busy</em> or <em>Finish Them</em> with it. <strong>When you have the Clumsy tag (usually by wearing Clumsy armor),</strong> you take -1 to <em>Get Away</em>.</p><p><strong>Dangerous:</strong> This item causes problems. <strong>When you use this item without careful preparation,</strong> there are always consequences, such as collateral damage or personal misfortune. There are upsides to having a Dangerous weapon - when you want collateral damage and lots of destruction, you'll find nothing better. Dangerous weapons count as Area weapons, and function the same in almost all ways, but they will always cause collateral damage when used.</p><p><strong>Dwarf-Made:</strong> Empowered by the secrets of dwarven craftsmanship, Dwarf-Made items are nearly indestructible. They cannot be destroyed by anything less than dragonfire or secrets known only to the dwarves.</p><p><strong>Elf-Made:</strong> Imbued with the secrets of the elves, Elf-Made items do not suffer the ravages of time. In addition, if someone holding an Elf-Made item is not an elf or a friend to the elves, it will burn them, forcing them to drop it.</p><p><strong>Necrotic:</strong> Necrotic attacks cause wounds that do not heal naturally. <strong>When you take damage from a Necrotic attack,</strong> mark that stat twice. The first mark cannot be removed by Filling Your Belly - you need Healing to properly recover from a Necrotic wound. Any Companions or enemies who are dealt damage by a Necrotic weapon are in Despair until it is healed, and cannot help or harm you.</p><p><strong>Orc-Made:</strong> Orc-made weapons are Clumsy in any hands but an orc's, and they are ugly to all but orcs.</p><p><strong>Piercing:</strong> Armor cannot be used against this attack's damage, and enemy threats cannot redirect this attack's damage. Also, when you use a Piercing attack, you can always choose which stat you are damaging with it.</p><p><strong>Reload:</strong> Whenever you use this weapon, you cannot use it again until you spend a safe moment reloading it. Weapons with this tag usually don't have Ammo - their main limit is demand, not supply.</p><p><strong>Slow:</strong> This takes a long time to use, and cannot be used under pressure. To use something with the Slow tag, you need both time and safety, otherwise you cannot use it at all.</p><p><strong>Thrown:</strong> This weapon can be thrown at enemies to attack them. <strong>When you attack at Range with this weapon,</strong> you lose it until it can be retrieved.</p><h3>Limited Tags</h3><p>Several items have a set number of Uses, and they will tell you how many. Often, these items will have unique abilities, triggered when you Use them. These tags give you specific things you can use them for, in addition to their unique uses. Once an item runs out of uses, it's out until you <em>Recover</em> or use another Move to get some back.</p><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Recover</strong></em><strong>,</strong> reset all of your Uses to the item's starting value, whether you used the item or not.</p><p><strong>Ammo:</strong> Ranged weapons have ammo. Ammo is an abstraction more than a hard-count of how many shots you have, and you can use this weapon as much as you like as long as you still have Ammo. <strong>When you use a Ranged weapon to </strong><em><strong>Keep Them Busy</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you need to use up 1 Ammo before you can roll. It never costs Ammo to <em>Overcome</em> something using a weapon with Ammo, unless the Ammo is the price you pay on a 7-9 result. <strong>If you have no Ammo left,</strong> you cannot use this weapon until you get more.</p><p><strong>Armor:</strong> It protects you. <strong>When you take damage,</strong> you may spend 1-Use of Armor to negate that damage. Armor is sometimes Clumsy - <strong>when you wear Clumsy armor,</strong> you take -1 to <em>Get Away</em>.</p><p><strong>Drunk:</strong> The opposite of Vigor. <strong>When you Use this item,</strong> it leaves you intoxicated and weakened for a short time. On your next roll, you roll with Despair and cannot have Hope. This will apply to whatever your next roll happens to be after using an item that makes you Drunk.</p><p>If a tag lists both Drunk and Vigor (ex: <em>Vigor</em>, then *Drunk), your next roll uses whichever tag is listed first. Your next roll after that uses the other tag.</p><p><strong>Food:</strong> It's edible, more or less. <strong>When you Fill Your Belly,</strong> you must Use Food.</p><p><strong>Healing:</strong> This item has healing properties, natural or magical. <strong>When you Use this item,</strong> the one who uses it or has it used on them heals 1 damage.</p><p><strong>Precious:</strong> Precious items are expensive and rare, making them excellent for trading, bartering, or bribing with. <strong>When you owe a favor as a result of the Move </strong><em><strong>Talk Sense</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you can give them a Precious item instead. <strong>When you give something Precious to someone,</strong> immediately <em>Forge a Bond</em> with them if they accept it.</p><p><strong>Useful:</strong> Useful items don't represent a specific item, but rather, a collection of things. When you Use this item, you produce something helpful for the situation. Exactly what the gear can produce is limited by what it is - for example, The Dwarf's Tunneling Gear can only produce tools and items related to tunneling - torches, pickaxes, shovels, climbing gear, miner's helmets, rope, that kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Vigor:</strong> The opposite of Drunk. <strong>When you use this item,</strong> you are full of power and feel unstoppable. On your next roll, you roll with Hope and cannot have Despair.</p><p>If a tag lists both Drunk and Vigor (ex: <em>Drunk</em>, then *Vigor), your next roll uses whichever tag is listed first. Your next roll after that uses the other tag.</p><p><strong>Traps:</strong> Traps are items you need to set up in advance to use. It costs 1 Use to place a trap, and you need time and safety to place it. If a trap never gets triggered, you can retrieve it later to regain its Use.</p><p>A trap may only be placed while you have time and safety. Anyone who sees you place a trap knows where it is, and you cannot trigger it on them while they're fully aware of their surroundings.</p><p><strong>When you set up a Trap,</strong> tell us the area you placed it in. <strong>When someone enters the trapped area,</strong> you may trigger it, and the trap simply happens to them. A Trap will only ever hit one enemy, unless it says otherwise or doesn't target enemies at all, like the Exploding Trap.</p><p><strong>Threats to the World</strong> cannot take damage from Traps, but their other effects all work as normal.</p><p>A set of Traps can be bought for 1 Use of something Precious, from most major marketplaces, traveling merchants, or supply outposts.</p><ul><li><strong>Arrow Trap</strong>: 2 Uses. Deal 1 damage to an undamaged enemy.</li><li><strong>Bear Trap</strong>: 3 Uses. Immobilize them until they pry free. It also causes immense, distracting pain when initially triggered.</li><li><strong>Exploding Trap</strong>:Dangerous, 2 Uses. Cave in a small room or narrow tunnel on cue, or blast open a wall or door on cue.</li><li><strong>Flashpowder Trap</strong>: 2 Uses. Blind everyone in the area for a short time.</li><li><strong>Pit Trap</strong>: 2 Uses. They fall into a hole.</li></ul><h2>Playbooks</h2><p>There are five types of Playbooks in <em>Fellowship</em>: Basic, Powerful, Destiny, Framework, and Team. Your playbook is your character - their abilities, notes, Agenda, Gear, and Moves. This book contains 6 Basic playbooks, one Powerful playbook, 16 Destiny playbooks, and one Framework playbook: The Overlord.</p><p>Future books have more playbooks of each type.</p><h3>Basic Playbooks</h3><p>The Basic playbooks are The Dwarf, The Elf, The Halfling, The Heir, The Orc, and The Squire. The one Powerful playbook is The Harbinger.</p><p>Basic playbooks start with 2 Custom moves, 7 Advancements, and can take a Destiny playbook later. You can find the Basic Playbooks in chapter 3.</p><h3>Destiny Playbooks</h3><p>Destiny playbooks are extremely powerful, but you cannot start the game with them. Instead, you unlock them later. You must be level 5 or higher, and you must meet the Destiny's requirements (usually a Fellowship move, but not always). You can find the Destiny Playbooks in chapter 5.</p><h3>Powerful Playbooks</h3><p>A Powerful Playbook has access to stronger moves than Basic Playbooks immediately, but they come with many downsides. The changes between a Basic and Powerful playbook are:</p><ul><li>Powerful Playbooks are not Basic Playbooks. Moves that tell you to take a Move from a Basic Playbook cannot take them from a Powerful Playbook. Powerful Playbook Moves can be Shared as normal.</li><li>Powerful Playbooks can never take a Destiny. They are everything they will ever be. However, Destiny Moves can be Shared with them.</li><li>Powerful Playbooks, after level 5, may become a <strong>Threat to the World</strong> as an Advancement option. At least two of their normal Advancements will also require them to be level 5 or higher. Some of their Advancements will give them access to Destiny Custom moves.</li><li>Powerful Playbooks will always have a move limiting their ability to use Bonds in some way (usually limiting them to one Bond per person). The stronger you are, the less you can relate to the world around you.</li><li>Powerful Playbooks only get one Custom Move during character creation instead of two.</li></ul><h3>Framework Playbooks</h3><p>Framework playbooks establish the premise of your game of Fellowship. During each game, only one player will use a Framework playbook, and they will only use one of them. Each Framework has completely different rules, making your game unique depending on which is in play.</p><p>The core Framework playbook is The Overlord, found in chapter 6.</p><h3>Team Playbooks</h3><p>Team playbooks are used cooperatively by the entire Fellowship. They level up like any other character, and give the Fellowship power so long as they can take care of it as a group. There are no Team playbooks in this first book, but The Rebellion and The Ship can be found in future books.</p>"

        "content": "<p>There are seven playbooks available to the Fellowship: The Dwarf, The Elf, The Halfling, The Harbinger, The Heir, The Orc, and The Squire. Each player may only have one playbook, and each playbook may only have one player - there is only one Harbinger.</p><p>The character sheets make creating characters and referencing your abilities significantly easier, so they are highly recommended. The character sheets for the playbooks are available at: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks\">http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks</a></p><h2>Creating Characters</h2><p><strong>1: Pick Your Playbook</strong></p><p>This step is easy. Look over the various playbooks available to you and pick your favorite. Look over their Moves and options, and choose the one that appeals to you the most.</p><p><strong>Once a player has picked a playbook, no one else may use that playbook.</strong> If more than one player wants the same playbook, talk it out like adults, and figure out if one of you would still be happy with something else.</p><p><strong>2: Choose Your Name, Look, and Agenda</strong></p><p>Each playbook has a set of Names and Looks to choose from, allowing you to fill out your character more quickly. Choose one or two names from each list, and choose one Look from each set of options. If you do not like the names or looks available, feel free to make up your own - they are suggestions, not truths. As in all things with <em>Fellowship</em>, you have the final say on what your people are all about, and this extends to how you look and how you are named.</p><p>Each playbook also has a few Agendas to choose between. Your Agenda is something your hero values and wants to do above all else, and whenever you are at a loss for what to do next, look to your Agenda and see if it makes your course of action clearer. Choose one of those Agendas now.</p><p><strong>3: Assign Your Stats</strong></p><p>Each playbook has a primary stat they use most, which starts out at +2. Your playbook will tell you which stat this is, but you can also consult this list:</p><p><strong>The Dwarf</strong> has +2 in their <strong>Iron</strong> stat.<br /><strong>The Elf</strong> has +2 in their Grace stat.<br /><strong>The Halfling</strong> has +2 in theirCourage stat.<br /><strong>The Harbinger</strong> has +2 in their <strong>Doom</strong> stat.<br /><strong>The Heir</strong> has +2 in their Wisdom stat.<br /><strong>The Orc</strong> has +2 in their Blood stat.<br /><strong>The Squire</strong> has +2 in their Sense stat.</p><p>Then, assign a $+2,+1,+0$, and -1 among the other 4 stats however you'd like. Higher numbers are better, so if you want to be Courageous or Graceful, put higher numbers into Courage or Grace.</p><p>The Dwarf and the Harbinger are special, in that they have 6 stats instead of 5. The Harbinger has an extra +0 to assign among their stats, and the Dwarf has an extra +1 to assign among their stats.</p><p><strong>4: Choose Your Moves</strong></p><p>Each playbook has a set of Core Moves, which every member of that playbook always gets. There is also a Move related to Your People - you only get one of those Moves, and the Move you choose defines the role your people have in the world at large. Lastly, each playbook has eight Custom Moves, and will tell you how many of them you get at the beginning of the game (usually two). You can obtain more of your Custom Moves when you Advance.</p><p><strong>5: Choose Your Gear</strong></p><p>Choose your Gear. The Gear options you pick represent what is commonly found among your people, along with at least one item unique to you. When you start the game, you will have all the Gear you chose. Each time you <em>Recover</em>, you reset all of your Gear back to what it was at the start. You can also restore some of your Gear between sessions, with the <em>End of Session</em> Move.</p><p>Any extra equipment or allies you find along your travels are not restocked when you <em>Recover</em>, only your Gear does. Be very careful with such things, and remember to record them separately.</p><p><strong>6: Create the Overlord</strong></p><p>At this point, you have done all you can with your character until the Overlord has been created. <strong>If you were making your character in advance, before the game proper, stop here.</strong> If you are the player playing as the Overlord, please refer to chapter 6 and make your Overlord now. If you made your Overlord in advance, before the session, now is when you introduce the other players to the Overlord they are facing.</p><p>Once the Overlord and the heroes of the fellowship have finished all of the previous steps and you are ready to play <em>Fellowship</em> for the first time together, move on to the last few steps.</p><p><strong>7: Establish Your People's Lore</strong></p><ul><li><strong>See Chapter 4 for a lot more detail on this step.</strong></li></ul><p>You are the primary source of all information on your people, and the options you have already made tell us a lot about them. Each player should introduce their character now, along with three facts about their people, their culture, or the world they live in.</p><p>It is highly recommended you look to Chapter 4 and go through the Guided Establishment method now, especially for your first time playing <em>Fellowship</em>. If you want to jump in faster, use the <em><strong>Jumping Right In</strong></em> method in that chapter instead. If you want to spend a lot of time setting up and investing in the world you're making together, use the <strong>Maximum Establishment</strong> method in that chapter instead.</p><p>Once everyone has had a chance to share some information on their people, enough that you all have a clear idea of the world you're playing in, move on to the next step. But be sure to know that this step never really ends, and you will be establishing your people's lore for as long as you play <em>Fellowship</em>.</p><p><strong>8: Pick the Overlord's Bonds</strong></p><p>Before picking Bonds with the other players, it is very important that each member of the fellowship knows their bonds with the Overlord. These Bonds have a major impact on you and your people. Overlord Bonds can never be removed by any means the fellowship has access to - they are here to stay.</p><p><strong>9: Pick Player Bonds</strong></p><p>Each player fills in at least one Bond with the other players, which informs your backstory and existing relationships. Bonds will change frequently, but it is important to set a baseline. You can have a maximum of 3 Bonds with the same person, and your playbook will tell you how many Bonds you start the game with.</p><p><strong>10: You're Ready To Play!</strong></p><p>Sit down, figure out where you're starting and what you're doing, and have fun! Chapter 4 has advice on how you might begin the game, and if it is your first time playing <em>Fellowship</em>, the Overlord should look over that advice now, choose an opener that sounds exciting, and start the game!</p><h1>The Dwarf</h1><p><strong>Basic Playbook</strong><br /><em>I have seen the bones of this world. The winds, howling against the mountains. Like the mountains, the Dwarves will never fall. We have endured. We will endure. But we know that nothin' lasts forever. This threat you called us all here for, we feel it. We know it's comin'. Tha's why I came, why I was chosen to represent my people.</em></p><p><em>Like a crop farmer takes winter, like an anvil takes blows, like a mountain takes an avalanche, so too shall I take this comin' darkness. The Dwarves will never fall, never yield, and never surrender.</em></p><p><em>I am the Dwarf. I can take it. Just you try me.</em></p><p>The Dwarf is built to last. Their people are the most solidly grounded people this world has to offer. The Dwarf offers you the ability to defend your allies well, clear a path through anything in your way, and keep on chugging in spite of the dangers.</p><p>Play as The Dwarf if you want to be built to take on anything, if you want to outlast the world, if you want to be the toughest person at the table, or if your thirst for treasure outweighs your common sense.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Choose one or two, or make up your own:</strong></p><h3>Given Names</h3><p><em>Austri, Aurvang, Bömbur, Dáin, Dvalin, Elda, Glóin, Hannar, Lofar, Nár, Ónar, Regina, Thórin, Thrór, Vestri, Vígg</em></p><h3>Clan Names</h3><p><em>Alebringer, Blackrock, Boathater, Broadbeam, Darkminer, Drakeslayer, Firewheel, Grimtrigger, Petty-Kin, Ploughswain, Skyforger, Stonefoot, Undermountain, Vulcan</em></p><h2>Look</h2><p><strong>Choose one from each list:</strong></p><ul><li>Weary Eyes, Hard Eyes, or Beady Eyes</li><li>Braided Beard, Flowing Locks, or Immaculate Sideburns</li><li>Calloused Skin, Bronzed Skin, or Stony Skin</li><li>Laborer's Leathers, Noble's Silks, or Soldier's Armor</li></ul><h2>Stats</h2><p>You begin with a +2 in Iron, a sixth stat only The Dwarf has.<br />Assign $+2,+1,+1,+0,-1$ to your other stats however you like.</p><h2>Agenda</h2><p>Choose one:</p><ul><li><strong>Insatiable Greed</strong></li></ul><p>Take for yourself that which was meant for others.</p><ul><li><strong>The Dwarven Craft</strong></li></ul><p>Create, restore, and protect things of lasting value.</p><ul><li><strong>The Honored Word</strong></li></ul><p>Keep your word in all things, and punish the liars and oath-breakers.</p><h2>Dwarven Core</h2><p>All Dwarves have the following Moves.</p><h3>People of Stone</h3><p>The dwarves are built tough. You have a sixth stat, Iron, and you have an additional +1 to assign between your other stats. Iron represents your supreme toughness - your armor, survivability, iron gut, and stubbornness.</p><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em><strong> by outlasting them in a contest of power or endurance,</strong> roll +Iron. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> they pass out.</p><p><strong>When you share this Move with another,</strong> their Iron stat is +1.<br /><strong>When someone who does not have an Iron stat uses a Move that rolls +Iron,</strong> they roll at +0.</p><h3>Clear the Path (Iron)</h3><p><strong>When you charge through something standing between you and where you're going,</strong> roll +Iron.</p><p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> you charge through and leave a path for your allies to follow.<br /><strong>On a 9-,</strong> your reckless charge causes problems. You have to go alone, or leave yourself open to danger, or damage something important, your choice.</p><h3>Unbreakable</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Fill Your Belly</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you also heal your Iron stat.</p><h2>What ls A Dwarf?</h2><p>Choose the option that best represents your people:</p><h3>Deepdelve</h3><p>Your people dig deeper than any others, and the secrets of the earth are yours. You can see in total darkness without a problem, and your armor is born of the secrets that can only be found deep underground.</p><p>Add <em>The Secrets (3 Uses)</em> to your Gear. You can Use them at any time to ask a question from the <em>Look Closely</em> or <em>Speak Softly</em> lists.</p><h3>Firebeard</h3><p>Your people lead a war-like life, with a long history of bloodshed and tragedy. Your armor has seen many battles, and it has seen you through all of them. <strong>When you attempt to defeat an enemy in glorious combat,</strong> you may damage your Blood to try to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Blood or +Sense.</p><h3>Ironblast</h3><p>Your people are madcap inventors and chemists, known throughout the world for their wondrous, and dangerous, creations. Your armor is of unusual design, with many bits and pieces that serve no obvious purpose.</p><p>Add <em>Various Explosive Devices (2 Uses, Dangerous)</em> to your Gear. You can Use your explosives to create an explosion wherever you need it, as long as you could have conceivably planted them ahead of time.</p><h3>Stoneborn</h3><p>Your kin have more in common with the earth and stone than they do with the flesh and blood of the other peoples. Your armor is your bare skin, solid as stone.</p><p><strong>When you stand on solid ground,</strong> you cannot be knocked off your feet or moved unless you want to be, and you can stop anything trying to get past you by <em>Keeping Them Busy</em> with +Iron.</p><h2>Dwarven Gear</h2><p>You have dwarven hardtack (Food, 5 Uses) and a solid means of protection, describe it (1 Use, Armor).</p><p><strong>Choose your weapon; all are Melee and Dwarf-Made. Name it.</strong></p><ul><li>A fine axe, gilded and engraved</li><li>A heavy hammer, stamped with the seal of a master smith</li><li>A simple mace, plain but functional</li><li>Your fists, harder than any stone</li></ul><p><strong>What do the dwarves have that no one else does?

You wear heavy armor (1 Use, Armor) and carry a shield (2 Uses, Armor, Clumsy) made of the stuff.</li><li>Strong alcohol. You carry a small keg of dwarven stout (4 Uses, Vigor, then Drunk).</li></ul><p><strong>The Dwarves are famous for their trade, whatever it may be.

Choose another player - you have an <strong>Unbreakable Bond</strong> with them, write it now. Nothing can undo this Bond you share with them.</li></ul><h2>Initial Bonds</h2><p>You start with 3 Bonds with the other members of the fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p><p>I owe ______ a life debt.<br />______ knows of my secret shame.<br />I would rather die at ______'s side than anywhere else in the world.<br />______'s forefathers and mine knew one another.<br />______ has been trusted with a great dwarven secret.<br />______ is my drinking buddy.<br />______ is a friend to all dwarves.<br />______ is my rival, and I theirs.<br />I grudgingly respect ______'s style.<br />Nobody can fight by my side like ______ can!</p><h2>Dwarven Custom</h2><p>Choose two of these Moves to further define what it means to be a Dwarf.</p><h3>All That Glitters...</h3><p>When you have a bad feeling about this and say as much, you may ask the Overlord \"Is there a trap or ambush here? If so, where would it come from?\" They will answer honestly.</p><h3>Dig Deep</h3><p>Your people are famous for their ability to dig quickly and safely. You can <em>Clear the Path</em> right through earth and stone, digging out a tunnel anyone can use. It will take some time, but not as long as anyone else would expect it to.</p><h3>Earth Friend</h3><p>You can speak to the mountains and hear the words of the stones.<br /><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Speak Softly</strong></em><strong> with the earth,</strong> you may use one of your questions to ask it to move for you. For you, the earth can create pits or one-room caves, collapse or clear stone passageways, or leave behind a message that only dwarves will notice.</p><h3>Good For What Ales You</h3><p><strong>When you use an item with the Drunk tag,</strong> act as though it had the Healing tag instead.</p><h3>Greed is Good</h3><p><strong>When you desire a treasure or valuable item you have seen or heard of,</strong> you may declare it to be the object of your greed.</p><p><strong>When you act directly to secure the object of your greed for yourself,</strong> you are filled with Hope.

They must answer truthfully.</p><ul><li>Who made this and why should I care about them?</li><li>What was this made to do, and how do I use it or break it?</li><li>What's wrong with this, and how might I fix it?</li></ul><h3>Warrior's Pride (Blood)</h3><p><strong>When you let out a roar of challenge,</strong> tell us who you are challenging and roll +Blood.</p><p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> they accept, approaching you for battle and dropping whatever they were doing.</p><p><strong>On a 9-,</strong> they bring back up with them.</p><h2>Dwarven Advancement</h2><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from the list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Increase your Blood or Wisdom by 1 (to a maximum value of +3).</li><li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum value of +3).</li><li>Take another Dwarven Custom.</li><li>Take another Dwarven Custom, or ask another player to share a Move with you.</li><li>Take another Dwarven Custom, or two more Dwarven Gear options.

You can also run along walls, up trees, and across treacherous surfaces safely, although only for short distances. You still need to roll to <em>Get Away</em> if you use this Move to escape danger.</p><h2>What ls An Elf?</h2><p>Choose the option that best represents your people:</p><ul><li><strong>Faerie</strong></li></ul><p>Your kin are faeries or nature spirits.

You can see perfectly in the dark, and your body is quite unlike those of flesh and blood.

All this Overlord stuff is just an excuse to see more than your garden, and you're going to make sure you see everything there is to see!</p><p><strong>Once per scene,</strong> you may ask one question from the <em>Look Closely</em> list without rolling.</p><ul><li><strong>Remembered by History</strong></li></ul><p>You want to be a hero so bad, even if the only way to do it is to tag along with the real heroes.</p><p><strong>Whenever anyone near you goes anywhere,</strong> you can always choose to tag along with them, even if doing so should be impossible.</p><h2>Squire's Gear</h2><p>You start with some simple food (4 Uses, Food), traveler's gear (2 Uses, Useful), and a simple sword (Melee).</p><p><strong>Choose what you brought to keep yourself safe:</strong></p><ul><li>Under-armor (1 Use, Armor) and bandages (2 Uses,*healing, slow)</li><li>A sturdy spear (Melee, Ranged, Thrown) and poultices (2 Uses,healing, slow)</li><li>A heavy crossbow (Ranged, Piercing, Reload)</li><li>A bear trap (Trap, 3 Uses). It immobilizes them until they pry free. It also causes immense, distracting pain when initially triggered.</li></ul><p>You were more prepared than anyone else on this adventure, and you brought along some extra supplies just in case. <strong>Choose one:</strong></p><ul><li>A horse or pony for everyone. No one has any Bonds with them - if they are damaged, they are lost until you <em>Recover</em>.</li><li>Some extra food (4 Uses,Food)</li><li>A spare weapon, identical or very similar to one someone else carries</li><li>A bottle of rum (2 Uses, <em>Drunk</em>, then <em>Vigor</em>)</li></ul><p>You weren't supposed to be here, but you are. What extra luck did you bring? <strong>Choose one:</strong></p><ul><li>Luck of the devil (1 Use). Use this to completely escape harm unscathed.</li><li>A friend in need (1 Use). Use this to have someone helpful show up, right now.</li><li>The Overlord's Weakness, although you don't know you have it.</li></ul><h2>Initial Bonds</h2><p>You start with 4 Bonds with the other members of the fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p><p>I have ______ 's back, no matter what.<br />______ looks out for me.<br />I know I can trust ______ no matter what.<br />I've never seen someone as cool as ______ before.<br />______ is always willing to listen to me, even when no one else has time.<br />I've bailed ______ out of trouble more times than I can count.<br />I don't know why but ______ really trusts me.<br />I'd do anything for ______ .<br />______ and I have shared a moment of peace together.<br />I am afraid of losing ______ .<br />I think ______ likes me romantically, but its hard to believe.<br />I try so hard to live up to ______ 's expectations.</p><h2>Squire's Custom</h2><p>Choose two of these Moves to further define what it means to be the Squire.</p><h3>Eager Apprentice</h3><p><strong>When someone you have a Bond with talks you through it,</strong> you can use one of their Moves. <strong>If they are another player,</strong> you can only use a Move that they could Share with you. <strong>If they are a Companion or an enemy,</strong> you must damage one of your stats to use one of their Moves. You may only borrow one Move per scene.</p><h3>I've Got a Bad Feeling About This</h3><p><strong>When you're certain something's wrong here,</strong> you may ask the Overlord to tell you the safest way out, and also the quickest way out. They will answer truthfully.</p><h3>I Won't Let You Down!</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Keep Them Busy</strong></em><strong> and get a 7-9,</strong> you may erase a Bond to take the 10+ result instead. The Bond must either be with someone you are protecting, or with someone who is helping you to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>.</p><h3>Power of Friendship</h3><p>Your Bonds have the tags Precious and Useful, and you can Use them by erasing them.</p><p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p><h3>Run For It!</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Get Away</strong></em><strong> by running right past or right through the danger,</strong> roll +Courage instead of +Grace. Any allies who run after you may also roll +Courage instead of +Grace to <em>Get Away</em>.</p><h3>Teach Me Your Ways</h3><p>Choose a Move another player knows. That Move must be one they can share. They share that Move with you.</p><p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p><h3>Voice of Reason</h3><p>You alone are the voice of reason in this insane world.<br /><strong>When you offer advice to another player and they ignore it,</strong> you are filled with Hope during any attempts to bail them out of whatever mess they got themselves into. Basically, i<strong>f you could say \"I told you so\" after your action,</strong> you have Hope to do it.</p><h3>We'll Make It</h3><p>Your Bonds have the Healing tag, and you can Use them by erasing them. Your Bonds can only be used to heal the person listed in them, and only while you are by their side.</p><p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p><h2>Squire Advancement</h2><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from the list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Increase your Courage or Wisdom by 1 (to a maximum value of +3 ).</li><li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum value of +3 ).</li><li>Take another Squire Custom.</li><li>Take another Squire Custom, or share aMove with someone.</li><li>Choose a player. They share aMove with you.</li><li>Choose a different player. They share aMove with you.</li><li>You have Changed. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When you Change, choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li></ul><h2>Squire Companions</h2><p>A Squire's only Companions are the horses, but anyone can be a new friend. For example:</p><p><strong>Donkey:</strong> Donkeys are similar to horses except a little smaller, with much more stamina, and with an endless supply of stubbornness.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Beast of Burden</p><p><strong>Horse:</strong> A horse, of course.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Run Like The Wind</p><p><strong>Politician:</strong> They have their own agenda, but it has nothing to do with you or the Overlord. Probably.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Political Power, Spineless</p><p><strong>Ogre:</strong> A simple creature, an Ogre is easily confused and easily misled. But just as easily, they will destroy your house or crush your head.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Giant's Strength, Huge Club, Tough As Nails, A Simple Mind.</p><p><strong>Monster:</strong> This massive creature is smarter than it looks and eager to prove its worth.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Big And Strong, Caught One!, Eager To Please</p><p><strong>Small Army</strong>: Untrained and poorly armored, these warriors are nevertheless dedicated to their cause.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Body Count, Poke 'Em Good</p><p><strong>Zombie:</strong> shamble. hunt. lunge. eat. braaaains. Nearly mindless, but potentially tamed if fed properly and often.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Painless, Simpleton Hivemind</p>"

        "content": "<h2>The First Session</h2><p>In Chapter 3: Being The Fellowship, the very first thing it tells you is how to create a <em>Fellowship</em> character, a hero you will play as to topple the evil Overlord. The first 5 steps you can do on your own, before everyone sits down to start playing together, and is primarily a solo exercise.</p><p>This chapter is dedicated entirely to the last four steps, which won't happen until everyone is sitting down together to play the first session of your <em>Fellowship</em> adventure. To remind you, this is the list of everything you need to do before you begin to play the game:</p><p><strong>1: Pick Your Playbook</strong><br /><strong>2: Choose Your Name, Look, and Agenda</strong><br /><strong>3: Assign Your Stats</strong><br /><strong>4: Choose Your Moves</strong><br /><strong>5: Choose Your Gear</strong><br /><strong>6: Create The Overlord</strong><br /><strong>7: Establish Your People's Lore</strong><br /><strong>8: Pick the Overlord's Bonds</strong><br /><strong>9: Pick Player Bonds</strong><br /><strong>10: You're Ready To Play!</strong></p><p>Each playbook in the <em>Fellowship</em> is will walk you through those first 5 steps, quickly and easily. Chapter 6 is dedicated entirely to step 6 , and only the Overlord needs all the details there. This chapter is all about steps 7 and 10: establishing the world, and starting the game.</p><p>It is highly recommended that everyone perform these steps together, as a group. It can be before your first session, or you can do it in advance over a group chat program like Skype or Discord or going out for lunch together.</p><p>These steps cannot be done as a solo exercise - you are creating the world everyone at the table is going to share together, and you can't share by yourself. That's not how sharing works. So get everyone together, have a conversation, share some cool ideas, and make some cool plans.</p><h2>Establishing Lore</h2><p>By the time you reach this step, you've probably got a strong idea going for what your people actually are. You've already been asked, What Are The Orcs?, and you've been made to answer, before you even get here. You've chosen a few custom Moves, you've decided on your Agenda, and you've picked out some Gear, and all of that contributes to an idea of what your People are. Now it's your job to piece all that together into a single cohesive image, and share that image with everyone else.</p><p>There are a lot of questions to ask here, and a lot of answers you can all give, but the first one everyone should put on the table to answer together is:</p><p><strong>How deep do you want to go?</strong></p><p>Some people really love lore and culture and history, and this step is all about putting that all on the table. Establishing your lore and creating your world together is as much a part of this game and your adventure as the actual saving the day stuff is, and is very much a part of playing! The co-operative brainstorming you do together can be very fun and important for feeling invested in this world and what you're doing together within it.</p><p>Some people really don't care about all that stuff, though, and just want to go on an adventure. And that's completely valid, too. So the first thing you want to do, before anyone starts establishing anything, is to figure out where everyone sits on the issue of, \"How much do we want to talk about playing before we actually get to the playing?\"</p><p>Each player should answer this question separately. There's three main answers here, although you can go in-betweensies on any of them.</p><p>There's <strong>Guided Establishment</strong>, where you establish a couple bits you really want to be true by following an outline of what's important, but leave the rest up in the air for later. <strong>This is the recommended method for starting your game of </strong><em><strong>Fellowship</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p>There's <strong>Maximum Lore</strong>, where you go into tons of nitty gritty bits and establish some cool cultural norms and some historical events for everybody, and spend a lot of time spit-balling. This method takes the longest and involves going in deep and covering as much as you want to.</p><p>And then there's <em><strong>Jumping Right In</strong></em>, where you establish just the most important couple things so you can just start playing heroes and overlords.</p><p>There is no wrong answer to this question. If everyone agrees on one, perfect! Go right to that section of this chapter and dig into it. If no one agrees, I recommend following the <strong>Guided Establishment</strong> method, as it is fairly quick while also giving everyone a chance to establish the world.</p><h2>Guided Establishment</h2><p><em>a.k.a. Cool Ideas Time</em></p><p>Guided Establishment is a method of establishing the world in a quick, focused manner by following a simple world-building process together. <strong>This is the recommended way to play </strong><em><strong>Fellowship</strong></em><strong>,</strong> although there's nothing wrong with Maximum Lore or <em>Jumping Right In</em> either. The Guided Establishment method has some questions you'll answer together and some you'll answer individually, and you'll want to keep notes on your answers to all of them.</p><p>The Guided Establishment method is best for when people have ideas, and they want to share them, but you either don't have solid specifics or don't want to spend the time creating them. It is a broad strokes method of painting what's important to your hero and your people while leaving the rest of the world blank, for you to fill in later when it matters.</p><p>The first step of the Guided Establishment method is to have everyone introduce their character, including the Overlord.</p><p><strong>Tell us about your hero, tell us why you are your people's champion, and then tell us three facts about your people.</strong></p><p>Your introductions give everyone a quick, baseline idea of your people and what our world is like, right from the get go. Your facts about your people are absolutely true and known by everyone. Once everyone has introduced themselves, answer these three questions together as a group:</p><p><strong>Whose people did the Overlord hit first and hardest? Whose people has the Overlord mostly ignored? What impossible thing has the Overlord already done?</strong></p><p>Now we've established the stakes. We know who is worried and who isn't, and we know why the world is suddenly paying attention to the Overlord, and why you've all been brought together. At this point, <strong>establish everyone's Bonds with the Overlord</strong>. Each player chooses one Overlord Bond from the list and writes their name in the blank.</p><p>Once those Bonds are completed, each player answers this next prompt individually:</p><p><strong>Choose another player. Tell us a rumor or superstition your people hold about their people. They cannot tell you whether or not its true.</strong></p><p>Once you establish a rumor or superstition, they must write it down on their playbook, and then it is their turn to establish one about someone else. You cannot double up - if someone's already made a rumor about the Dwarves, you cannot pick the Dwarves when its your turn to establish something. Don't forget to make a rumor about the Overlord, too. The last player will establish a superstition about the first player.</p><p>Once everyone has had a rumor or superstition established about their people, its time to pick your players' Bonds. Starting with one player, fill in as many Bonds as your playbook tells you to in the blanks on your sheet's Bonds section, and be sure to tell everyone what your Bonds are. You may have some additional Bonds given to you by your Gear - fill those in, too, before moving on to the next player to repeat the process.</p><p>Your Bonds do not have to be with the other players, although many of them should be. You may take Bonds with anyone who is established to exist: Your Companions, other players' Companions, even the Overlord or one of their Generals. The only limit to writing a starting Bond is that you must know their name, and the Bond you write must be true.</p><p>If a Bond you're making doesn't really fit with any of the pre-written Bonds, write your own Bond. Do this as often as you need to when forging new Bonds or defining your starting Bonds.</p><p>Once everyone's Bonds are sorted out, you're ready to start playing.</p><p><strong>Going Deeper:</strong> If you have a bit more time, you can add more questions to the Guided Establishment method. The above questions give you a strong starting point, but maybe you want to know a little more, maybe you have some things you want to say, but you don't want the chaotic free-for-all of the Maximum Lore method. Here's some more questions you can put to the table:</p><p><strong>Who are your people on good terms with? How about bad terms? Why?</strong><br /><strong>What's one thing your people have that no one else does?</strong><br /><strong>What is the political structure of your peoples' society?</strong><br /><strong>What do your people most value? What do they least value?</strong><br /><strong>What is your people's greatest accomplishment?</strong><br /><strong>What is your largest city called, and what is it like?</strong></p><h2>Maximum Lore</h2><p><em>a.k.a. Just Keep Talking</em></p><p>Maximum Lore is about giving everyone all the time they want to tell us everything. Just start talking together and don't stop until you've all run out of things to say. Put it all on the table, and maybe take a lot of notes.</p><p>The Maximum Lore method is best for when you have a lot of time to just put things out there. If you have all day and nowhere to be, this can be a really fun way to spend it. If everyone's in a group chat together on Skype and you know you won't be able to play the game for a week, you can start establishing lore immediately. Just start typing up ideas. Chat rooms are especially ideal for this because they can save a log, and you don't need to take notes so closely when everyone can go back and look at exactly what everyone said later.</p><p>It can help to make a map. Draw a rough shape on a big piece of paper or a shared painting room online, and then just let people start filling it in with stuff. Mark out the regions your people control, and label dots and terrain features and Notable Places You Probably Want To Go At Some Point. Figure out where you want your adventure to start, and then put a big dot somewhere far away from that point where the Overlord's base is.</p><p>When considering your people's culture, it can help to think about the things they value most and work backwards from there. What is the absolute most important thing in your culture? What values and norms and laws came about because of that? Then, what is the absolute least important thing to your culture? And what values, norms, and laws does that answer bring you?</p><p>It's also important to remember you're all establishing a world together, not alone. Listen to other peoples' ideas, and make changes accordingly. You have the final say on everything related to your people, but the whole world doesn't revolve around them (probably). If someone else has a really good idea about something you said, listen to them. Maybe its cooler than what you had in mind, and you can work that into what you had going on. Maybe it isn't, and you should tell them about your better idea and make it clearer for everyone so we all know about it. But it's important that you at least listen.</p><p>The other important point of establishing a world together is that your people are not in a vacuum, and exist alongside everyone else's. Consider how they react to each other, how they relate to one another on both a personal and international level. Are they friends? Enemies? Trading partners? What superstitions do your people have about the Dwarves, the Harbingers, the Elves, or whoever else? Are relationships good, rocky, or completely busted?</p><p>And lastly, consider the Overlord. The Overlord should establish their own Lore as well, and its important for you to consider how your people are reacting to their sudden conquests. Who was hit hardest? Who has the</p><p>Overlord done nothing to yet? Who reacts poorly to the situation, and who reacts quickly and decisively? What does the world at large think about all this?</p><p>As for the Overlord player, you are allowed to be cagey and secretive about your details in a way no one else is allowed to be. You are a new power in this world, sudden and strange. You have secrets and twists none of the others do, and you may even lie to them about some things. You cannot lie about your Stats or Weaknesses, and you probably shouldn't lie about what your army is, the territories you've seized, and how much harm you've already caused. But you can absolutely lie about your Generals, your past, and what you do with those you capture or conquer. Strike terror into their hearts and undo what they know and revere, Overlord.</p><p>An important note about the Maximum Lore method is to not go on too long with any one player. No matter how cool your Elves are, people will get tired of hearing about them for 20 minutes if no one else gets to talk about their cool people. So if you're going over one thing about your people, instead of moving on to the next thing about them when you're done, have someone else tell them about that same thing with their people, and go around with everyone. This helps keep interest high and improves everyone's engagement with the world you're all creating together.</p><p>Of course, sometimes you're the only one in your online chat and you have a lot of ideas - if there's no one else you need to keep interested, feel free to just keep typing into that chatroom for everyone to see later. If no one wants to read your five pages you put up, give 'em the cliff notes later.</p><p>There are a lot of subsections to Maximum Lore, but feel free to skip any of them that don't interest you. As long as you write down your ideas, have fun with everything, and (most importantly) stop establishing when people get bored, you are playing the game correctly. The right moment to move on from establishing the world to playing in the world is the exact moment someone wants to start playing in the world, and not a moment sooner.</p><p>When everyone's got everything out there, you just need to establish everyone's Bonds, and then you're ready to play!</p><p><strong>Going Over The Highlights:</strong> If you end up using Maximum Lore, it can be easy to forget some things here and there. If you have time and a real love for your setting, going over the Guided Establishment method before the first session may still be a good idea, so everyone's on the same page and knows what's most important from all you've talked about so far before you get to the game.</p><h2>Jumping Right In</h2><p><em>a.k.a. Let's Go Already</em></p><p>Sometimes you don't have patience for all of that other stuff. Sometimes you don't have time for all that lore, even if you want to get into it. And that's cool. Let's get right to it then.</p><p><em>Jumping Right In</em> is best when you're impatient, or on a time limit. If you're playing <em>Fellowship</em> at a convention, in an after-school club, for a podcast, or at a public room in your local library or gaming store, you might only have a 3 or 4 hour time slot to play in, and you might not ever be coming back to the game. If you spend that entire time just talking about the world, you won't actually get to play, and then all that world building may go right to waste. When you're in that kind of situation, you need to <em>Jump Right In</em>.</p><p>First things first, have everyone make their characters quick. Hand them whatever playbook they're most interested in, and tell them to only choose default options - choose a name, choose a look, don't pick Gear or Moves you need to write stuff in for. Once they've followed all the steps on their sheet, starting with whoever finished first, its time for introductions.</p><p><strong>Tell us about your hero, tell us why you are your people's champion, and then tell us three facts about your people.</strong></p><p>Your introductions give everyone a quick, baseline idea of your people and what our world is like, right from the get go. Your facts about your people are absolutely true and known by everyone.</p><p>The Overlord should also introduce themselves at this time, but they go last. Ideally, if you're on a time limit, you'll have made your Overlord in advance, so you're all ready to go and you can help everyone else make their heroes. Alternatively, you can ask the players to take a 5 minute break while you put together your Overlord quickly. Either way, your introduction and three facts come last, and then you assign Overlord Bonds.</p><p>Once those are sorted out, fill out your Player Bonds, again using only the default ones instead of spending time making up your own. Once those are all filled in and ready to go, you're ready to play! Get to it.</p><p><strong>Going Deeper:</strong> If you want to go deeper, just use the Guided Establishment method.</p><p><strong>Going Quicker:</strong> Don't. This method is already at the bare minimum amount of information everyone should have about everyone else's characters and the world. Trimming even this method down is not recommended.</p><h2>You'ree Ready To Play</h2><p>Hooray!</p><p>Unfortunately, this is often the hardest part of starting a game of Fellowship. Once you get the ball rolling, its very easy to get in the groove and keep at it. The Guided Establishment method can help everyone get in the gaming mindset, but it does little to start the adventure. This section is all about getting started on a strong foot, and the rest of the game should follow from there.</p><p>The most important advice I can give is that <strong>the heroes should already be grouped together when the game starts</strong>. DO NOT start with the story of how they met, or how they got together, or why they've decided the Overlord is a threat, or any of that. There is no quicker way to kill momentum than for everyone to try to scrounge up reasons you're working together. While this makes good drama in a book, it makes terrible drama in a game, because it takes a lot of time and does nothing but distract from the adventure.</p><p>You have your Bonds for a reason - you know each other, you've been traveling together, and for one reason or another, the fellowship has already been formed. If anyone wants to establish further backstory amongst the fellowship, great! That's just fine. You can <em>Command Lore</em> about it, or Forge Bonds over it. The important thing, no matter what, is that it has already happened, you are already friends, you know each other, and you're ready to go.</p><p>Other than that, any opening stage the Overlord wants to set for their heroes should be fine. Get these heroes heroing, and the game will almost play itself from there.</p><p>If you're having trouble coming up with a way to start things (and I always do, so I sympathize), there's three solid methods that always work to get things started in <em>Fellowship</em>. They all share the same core idea: thrust the heroes into a dangerous situation, and then let them figure out why they're there and what they're doing after the fact.</p><p>The difference between these three methods is what kind of situation you put them in. There's <strong>The Chase</strong>, where they are on the run from danger. There's <strong>The Set Piece</strong>, where they will start at the beginning of a cool premade challenge. And then there's <strong>The Overlord Strikes</strong>, where the opening scene is the heroes' first time actually meeting their monstrous nemesis in person.</p><h2>The Chase</h2><p><em>a.k.a. We're In Trouble Now, Chewie</em></p><p>The Chase starts with you asking a few simple questions, preferably to as many different players as possible. In order, ask them:</p><p><strong>Who (or what) is chasing you?</strong><br /><strong>Why is it impossible to fight them?</strong><br /><strong>What did you take from them?</strong><br /><strong>Which of you is having trouble keeping up?</strong><br /><strong>After you turn the next corner, what obstacle is right in your way?</strong></p><p>And then get rolling from there. Use their answers, and hopefully find appropriate Threats from chapter 7 to chase them or get in their way, according to their answers.</p><p>Ask them further questions as necessary. Make Cuts as often as you need to. Make them roll Moves as often as possible, especially while they're still in danger.</p><p>Once they manage to get away, ask them what they need to do next with the thing they took from their pursuers. If they fail to escape and get captured, find out what their captors want from them and what they'll do to get it.</p><p>From there, the game is on!</p><h2>The Set Piece</h2><p><em>a.k.a. We're In Over Our Heads Here</em></p><p>This one is exceedingly simple: Pick any Set Piece from the book, and plop them down right at the beginning of it. Figure out why they need to go through the Haunted Forest, or why they need to play the Sports Tournament, and then just play right through it. Set Pieces are designed to be flashy, cool, and challenging, and as such they make a fantastic opener for your game.</p><p>If you have written your own Set Piece, this is a pretty good way to make sure you get to use it, no matter what else happens in your game.</p><h2>The Overlord Strikes</h2><p><em>a.k.a. Kiss Your World Goodbye</em></p><p>This is the most difficult of these three openers to pull off well, because the Overlord is dangerous, powerful, and deadly. Things can go very wrong very quickly when the Overlord is on the scene, and they do not mess around. Make sure you are very familiar with your Overlord's Foibles if you start the game with this opener, and don't open with this beat down if you have any players who really hate losing. Because chances are, they'll probably lose.</p><p>This opening starts with the first time the fellowship has actually met the Overlord as a group. Ask the fellowship these questions, in this order, to as many different players as possible:</p><p><strong>Where are you, and what does the Overlord want here?</strong><br /><strong>What are you all doing to try and thwart their plan?</strong><br /><strong>What lucky break got you this far?</strong><br /><strong>What's the last thing standing between you and stopping the Overlord's plan?</strong><br /><strong>What are you doing when you notice the Overlord is here?</strong></p><p>After asking this last question, its time to make your debut. Tell them about your Overlord - where they entered the scene from, how they carry themselves, how they look and act, and if anyone came with them.</p><p>Then, use every Move in your arsenal, make Cuts as hard as you'd like, and try your best to destroy them. Some Overlord Bonds will establish that you have met some of the heroes before. Start with your relationship with those heroes first, and work your way out from there. Do everything you can to keep them from thwarting your plan - this is a full on Showdown scene, with everything that involves, and you do not have to hold anything back.</p><p>If you destroy them, make one of them <em>An Offer You Can't Refuse</em>, then leave the scene, taking your objective with you.</p><p>If they manage to thwart your plan, regardless of whether you destroyed them or they escaped, you will show them your rage, then leave after causing great devastation.</p><p>If they manage to escape without thwarting your plan, leave them. You got what you came for, and they'll need to deal with the fallout of that later.</p><p>No matter how this ends up, the players will be nursing injuries, probably some flavor of defeat, and a healthy amount of fear of you, and determination to stop you.</p><p>Ask them what they intend to do next, and go from there. If they have no ideas, introduce someone they saved through their actions here, and have that person guide them forward. Give them a path to the Overlord, and set them on it. If they need help or ideas for how to move forward, provide them. If they have any ideas for how to move forward, encourage them, and those ideas will obviously work. Get the game rolling, and run with it from here. You've got it.</p><h2>Granting Fellowship</h2><p>As the game goes on, the heroes will earn the respect and aid of the people they've helped and saved on their journey. When that happens, you must grant them Fellowship - a powerful Move that represents the bond they have with this community. Fellowship Moves usually grant a bonus to the entire fellowship, such as teaching them a new Move, giving them equipment or Companions, or striking a direct blow against the Overlord.</p><p><strong>When they have earned Fellowship,</strong> the Overlord picks three Moves from any of the lists below. You can offer any three Moves you like - just because a Move is named Elven Hospitality doesn't mean it needs to be granted by an elven community. The three Moves offered need to fit the community offering the Moves, but you can rename the Moves as you see fit.</p><p>If none of the Fellowship options feel appropriate, you may write new Fellowship Moves to offer them instead. Try to keep any new Moves you write on roughly the same level as the existing ones. Fellowship Moves are supposed to be bonuses, not game-breakers.</p><h2>Fellowship Moves</h2><h3>A Beast Most Foul</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> you are given a pair of Strange Beasts. Two members of the fellowship each gain one Bond with one of the Beasts. The player who gained a Bond with a beast gets to decide what its two stats are.</p><h3>A Halfling at Heart</h3><p>Everyone in the fellowship takes the Halfling Core Move <em>Sting Like A Bee</em>. They can still only use it against those who are larger than they are.</p><h3>Allies of my People</h3><p>A neighboring community is allies with this one, and you gain Fellowship with them as well. You will receive that Fellowship and <em>Recover</em> as soon as you get there, and the Overlord will get no benefits from this future <em>Recovery</em>.</p><h3>Ancestral Spirits</h3><p>Your deeds have awakened the spirits of your ancestors, who had been laid to rest here. These ghostly spirits will haunt any minions of the Overlord who attempt to enter this place, driving them out and causing them great harm. This community can never fall to the Overlord. If the Overlord had plans to destroy this community, they lose those plans now.</p><h3>A Touch of Magic</h3><p>The Harbingers have shown you the secret to their power. The Harbinger shares their <em>Wizardry</em> Move with everyone in the fellowship. They each only get one of your <em>Wizardry</em> spells, as normal.</p><h3>Big Friend</h3><p>The Ogre who lives here has grown attached to you, and decided to come with. One of you has two Bonds with it.</p><p><strong>Ogre:</strong> A simple creature, an Ogre is easily confused and easily misled. But just as easily, they will destroy your house or crush your head.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> <em>Giant's Strength</em>, <em>Huge Club</em>, <em>Tough As Nails</em>, <em>A Simple Mind</em>.</p><h3>Blade of Darkest Night</h3><p>One of you is given a powerful, cursed weapon. It has the tags Melee and Necrotic. The player who is taking it describes what it looks like. It whispers dark and terrible secrets to whoever holds it, giving them insight into the world, but also driving them slowly mad.</p><p>The holder of this weapon can <em>Command Lore</em> about dark and terrible things, and gains the Agenda <strong>Always Dig Deeper:</strong> You need to know every secret and find every treasure, and you despise secrets and secret-keepers.</p><h3>Blessings of Fire</h3><p>The fire elementals who live here have given you their blessing. You all gain supernatural resistance to heat and flame, adding <em>Fire Resistance</em> (Armor vs. Fire, 1 Use) to your Gear. In addition, one of you is given a powerful weapon of fire (Ranged*, *Reload) that ignites whatever it strikes. This weapon is one of a kind, and is not added to your Gear.</p><h3>Bountiful Harvest</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> each member of the fellowship is given some <em>Elven Bread</em> (Food, 4 Uses).</p><h3>Bring the Whole Family</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Forge a Bond</strong></em><strong> with a new Companion here,</strong> you also <em>Forge a Bond</em> with a second, identical Companion with a different first name. <strong>When you first take this Move,</strong> the player who picked it can <em>Forge a Bond</em> with a Halfling Brave, Chef, or Fast-Talker right now, for free.</p><p><strong>Halfling Brave:</strong> A more loyal and earnest warrior you will never find.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> <em>Loyal Beyond All Reason</em>, <em>Get Right In There</em></p><p><strong>Halfling Chef:</strong> If you've got the food, they'll make it tasty.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> <em>Special Ingredients</em>, <em>Rations</em> (Food, 2 Uses)</p><p><strong>Fast-Talker:</strong> If you'll just listen, you'd understand...<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> <em>Mixed-Metaphor-a-Minute</em>, <em>Natural Charm</em></p><h3>Dedicated to the Cause</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> a Small Army comes with you. Everyone in the fellowship has one Bond with them. <strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Fill Your Belly</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you may Use 1 Food to heal the Small Army.</p><p><strong>Small Army:</strong> Untrained and poorly armored, these warriors are nevertheless dedicated to their cause.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Body Count, Poke 'Em Good</p><h3>Dragon Slayers</h3><p>This community is eternally grateful you defeated the dragon terrorizing them, and have given you items made from its body. Each player chooses one of the following to add to their Gear:</p><ul><li>A weapon of dragon bone and blood (Melee) that burns whatever it strikes</li><li>Durable armor of dragon skin (1 Use, Armor) and (1 Use, Armor vs. Fire).</li><li>Dragonfire Drought (1 Use, Ranged, Dangerous), which gives you the ability to breathe fire for the rest of the scene when you drink it.</li></ul><h3>Don't Knock It 'Til You Try It</h3><p>The fellowship can use orc-made weapons as though you were all orcs they are not Clumsy in your hands, and while they may not be beautiful, you can admire their effectiveness. The orcs here will also give you as many orc-made weapons as you like, free of charge. Each player can hold up to four Melee weapons, or two Melee weapons and one <em>Ranged</em> weapon (Orc-Made, Ranged, 3 Ammo).</p><h3>Dwarven Hospitality</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> two Dwarven Defenders come with you. Two members of the fellowship each gain one Bond with one of the Defenders.</p><p><strong>Dwarven Defender:</strong> Trained in the art of the tower shield, this dwarf will defend you through thick and thin.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Loyal, Shield-Bearer.</p><h3>Dwarven Training</h3><p>The fellowship is taught in the ways of being tough and strong. Everyone in the fellowship gains the Iron stat at +1, if they do not already have it. <strong>When they </strong><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em><strong> by outlasting them, out drinking them, or by slugging it out blow by blow until one of you falls,</strong> roll +Iron.</p><h3>Elevensies</h3><p><strong>Each time you leave this community,</strong> each member of the fellowship leaves with a halfling packed lunch (2 Uses, Food, each Use feeds three people).</p><h3>Elven Hospitality</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> two Elven Archers come with you. Two members of the fellowship each gain one Bond with one of the Archers.</p><p><strong>Elven Archer:</strong> An expert with the bow. It is said that elven archers never miss.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Perfect Shot, An Even More Perfect Shot</p><h3>Elven Training</h3><p>The Elf shares the *<em>Elder Art</em>s* Move with everyone in the fellowship. They each get only one of your *<em>Elder Art</em>s* spells, as normal.</p><h3>Finer Goods You'll Never See</h3><p>Each of you receives an elven treasure - an item of such extreme value that many would give their lives just to look at it once. Describe the gift you were given. It is Precious and Elf-Made, in addition to any other properties it has. The item you were given considers you a friend of elves and will not harm you.</p><h3>Ghost Town</h3><p><strong>When you gain the Fellowship of the sole person in this community,</strong> they fade away into nothingness. The entire town is now yours, with all its fortifications and riches, but the ghosts still linger here to attack those who mean you harm. <strong>If the Overlord had plans to destroy this community,</strong> they lose those plans now.</p><h3>Granted Nobility</h3><p>You have been given a villa within the city limits. The villa comes with a small contingent of servants to watch the place while you are away. Decide which of you owns the villa - that player gains a title, such as <em>Duke</em> or Countess, and they hold political sway within this community and among those that respect this community.</p><h3>Halfling Hospitality</h3><p>The Halflings have everything for sale that you could ever want, and they'll go out of their way to find specialty goods for you. Each player chooses another option from any one of their Gear lists, and adds that to their Gear. Everyone, tell us what they had to do to get you your stuff.</p><h3>Legendary Generosity</h3><p>Weapons, armor, and alcohol you purchase here cost you nothing, no matter how many you need. Each player chooses one of the following to add to their Gear:</p><ul><li>A fine dwarven weapon, made just for you (Melee, Dwarf-Made)</li><li>Heavy armor of stone or iron (3 Uses, Armor, Clumsy)</li><li>Dwarven stout (2 Uses, Food (only for Dwarves), Drunk: Wisdom + Sense, Vigor: Blood + Courage)</li></ul><h3>Many Died For This Information</h3><p>You are told the location of a Source of Power that the Overlord currently has a plan to find, and you are also told the location of a Source of Power that the Overlord has already. One of them is quite close by, your choice which, and this community will tell you all about it.</p><h3>Minecarts</h3><p>You have been given access to the vast underground network of dwarven mining tunnels, and you can use the mine carts in those tunnels to rapidly reach other dwarven settlements, or any other settlement the dwarves are particularly friendly with.</p><h3>One Ring to Rule Them</h3><p>The harbingers know much of the Overlord's inherent strengths and weaknesses, and by performing taxing, difficult rituals, they may create an item of power to defeat the Overlord with. The item they create becomes a new Weakness for the Overlord, one the Overlord does not know of. Describe how it looks and how you use it.</p><h3>Orcish Hospitality</h3><p><strong>While you are in this community,</strong> you find that the orcs will follow you everywhere you go. They watch your back, shut doors behind you, and will make sure you are never followed, harassed, or bothered. If they spot anything fishy, they let you know immediately, and if you want, they'll take care of it for you real quick, no sweat. It is impossible for you to be attacked or caught off guard as long as you are here.</p><h3>Our Forge is Your Forge</h3><p>The dwarves here will replace or re-forge as many of your weapons and vehicles as you like. All such items in any players' Gear gain the Dwarf-Made tag, making them effectively indestructible.</p><h3>Royal Protection</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> each member of the fellowship leaves with a Bodyguard. Each player has one Bond with their Bodyguard.</p><p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> A trained bodyguard, ready to dive in the way of an attack.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Watch Out!!!</p><h3>Shady Dealings</h3><p>You've got an in with the most powerful orc(s) in town. They can get you just about anything you need, if the price is right. At any time, you can revoke your Fellowship here to cash in and get anything you want from them - a major favor, a massive vehicle, serious funding, anything - and they will make it happen. <strong>If you somehow manage to pay them back,</strong> you regain your Fellowship here.</p><h3>Something Evil This Way Comes</h3><p><strong>When you flee from an enemy by retreating into this community,</strong> that enemy will suffer a horrible fate if they do not immediately turn back. If the <strong>Overlord had plans to destroy this community,</strong> they lose those plans now.</p><h3>The Elven Secret</h3><p><strong>Each player learns a single secret of the Elves.</strong> You will tell us what secret you learned when the time is right. The elven secrets can be anything, but they must be related to the wilds, the stars, the hunt, or elven mythology in some way. The secret can be anything, and it is guaranteed to be at least mostly true.</p><h3>The Lost Histories</h3><p><strong>Each player learns a single closely guarded secret of these people.</strong> Each player will tell us the secret they learned when the time is right. These secrets can be anything, but they must be related to the law, the old legends, the empires of the world, or these people's culture in some way.</p><h3>The Pleasures of a Nomadic Life</h3><p>This community has decided to come with you, traveling behind you for the rest of your adventure. You gain all the benefits of having a community within an hour's walk of you at all times, and they can always provide you new mounts and a safe place to rest, should you need them.</p><p>##3 The Secret To Success</p><p>The dwarves were hiding a special project down here. And even if it isn't entirely complete yet, there is no one better to give it to than the fellowship. You are given a <strong>Powersuit</strong>.</p><p><strong>Powersuit:</strong> A mechanical suit of armor that is more vehicle than clothing.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Powered Movement, Rocket Fist, Heavy Armor</p><h3>The Secret Weapon</h3><p>You are given a Siege Tank, to do with as you please.</p><p><strong>Siege Tank:</strong> This deadly armored war vehicle has more weaponry than it really needs, and its loaded with several single-use secret weapons.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Spikes and Steel, Heavily Armored, Secret Weapon</p><h3>To Dance Among Stars</h3><p><strong>Whenever you leave this community,</strong> you ride upon the wind to your next destination, arriving swiftly and safely and almost instantly.</p><h3>To War!</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> you do so inside a <strong>War Wagon</strong>.</p><p><strong>War Wagon:</strong> The War Wagon is a halfling carriage converted to war. Covered in spikes, it is mounted with a rock ballistae and a kitchen, for that extra taste of home.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Rock Ballistae, Spiked Armor, Built For War</p><h3>Tusks of Steel</h3><p><strong>Each time you leave this community,</strong> you gain a fully out-fitted war elephant, with a riding platform, armor, and bladed tusks.</p><p><strong>War Elephant:</strong> The largest in ground-based war animal technology, these massive creatures can support a small building on their backs. The APC of the fantasy age.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Tusks and Screaming, Armored Platform</p><h3>Upgraded Flesh</h3><p>The cyborgs of this community have agreed to share their gifts with you. They will give robotic prosthetics to any in the fellowship who need or want them. The prosthetics function just as well as the old flesh did, but they have abilities that the flesh simply does not. Anyone who gains a prosthetic adds Robotic Bits (2 Uses, Useful) to their Gear.</p><h3>War Boyz</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> two Big Lugs come with you. Two members of the fellowship each gain one Bond with one of them.</p><p><strong>Big Lug:</strong> Real big, real strong, real stupid.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Tough As Can Be, Bigger 'n You</p><h3>We Name You Elf-Friend</h3><p>Everyone in the fellowship is considered a friend of the elves, and can use Elf-Made items without harm. In addition, they will upgrade or replace as much of your Gear as you'd like with improved Elf-Made versions. You may add the Elf-Made tag to any weapons, armor, and tools in your Gear.</p><h3>Zombie House</h3><p><strong>When you leave this community,</strong> each member of the fellowship has two Zombies leave with them. These zombies will not attack anyone in the fellowship and they will follow your commands, but no one has any Bonds with them. <strong>If any zombie's Simpleton Hivemind stat is damaged,</strong> all of their Simpleton Hivemind stats become damaged.</p><p><strong>Zombie:</strong> shamble. hunt. lunge. eat. braaaains. Nearly mindless, but potentially tamed if fed properly and often.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Painless, Simpleton Hivemind</p>"

        "content": "<p>Destinies are that secret inside of you that only you know. They are your true self, the you that only comes out in times of dire need, and only after something has...</p><p><strong>...Changed.</strong></p><p>When a hero in the fellowship goes on being a hero long enough, they start to find their true self. The details beyond being just the champion of their people, the part of themselves that stands out from being just The Dwarf. It's the part that makes you more than a hero.</p><p>It's the part that makes you a legend.</p><p>And sometimes, that legend is just finding out that you're the best Dwarf who ever did Dwarf, and that's okay too. Maybe you were your true self all along. Or maybe, just maybe, your ideal, true soul is something different. Something beautiful. Or maybe something horrible. Let's find out together.</p><p>A <strong>Destiny</strong> is an advanced playbook, that you must meet certain requirements to obtain. You must be at least level 5, and you must fulfill an additional requirement listed in the specific Destiny.</p><p>When you choose the Advancement option <strong>You Have Changed</strong> from your basic playbook, you gain a Destiny playbook of your choice that you meet the requirements for. You take that Destiny's first Move immediately.</p><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong> after you've gained a Destiny,</strong> you can choose from either your basic playbook's Advancement list or your Destiny's Advancement list for what benefit you get for leveling up.</p><p>As long as you fulfill the requirements, you can take any Destiny available. You do not need to be the Halfling to become the Halfling Sheriff, as long as you have the Fellowship of the Halflings.</p><p><strong>If you do not meet the requirements for any of the available Destinies,</strong> you cannot Change.</p><p>You cannot choose a Destiny if another player has already taken that Destiny. Each of you has your own Destiny to find for yourselves.</p><p>You can never share Moves from a Destiny, and you can never take Moves from another Destiny than your own, with very rare exceptions. Destinies are exclusive from each other, and they are a big deal.</p><h2>A New Beginnng</h2><p>Your Destiny doesn't end here. In fact, you've been on the wrong path this entire time. Or maybe, you needed to walk that path to get to the point you are now. Either way, your future has changed, and you are not who you used to be anymore.</p><p><strong>Requirement:</strong> You want to start over.<br /><strong>Unlike other Destinies, even powerful playbooks like The Harbinger can take this Destiny, starting at level 5 and beyond.</strong></p><p>The New Beginning is not a Destiny playbook. It's a chance to start over. Your character will be reborn with a new focus, a new purpose, and with a new life in front of them. You have changed, in a way that is far more fundamental than any other Destiny will change you.</p><p><strong>When you take this Destiny,</strong> choose a new basic or powerful playbook from among any playbooks that aren't currently being used. That will be your new playbook. You will discard your current one, and take up the new one from here on out.</p><p>But your past doesn't disappear so easily. Some things from your old life will be coming with you. You must do each of the following steps:</p><ol><li>Copy your Bonds, Name, and Look. You keep all of your existing Bonds, and do not record any initial Bonds as part of gaining your new playbook. You do not change your name and look unless you want to.</li><li>Keep your Peoples move and Agenda. This is the move under the \"What is a Dwarf/Elf/Angel/Tinker/etc\" header on your playbook. If you have multiple Peoples moves or multiple Agendas, choose one of each to keep and discard the rest. You will also gain a new Peoples move and a new Agenda from your new playbook.</li><li>Keep any Moves that were Shared with you by others. You do not forget the lessons that others have taught you.</li><li>Choose one Move to keep. This can be any Core Move or Custom Move you know, even if it isn't one that started on your playbook.</li><li>Choose one Gear option to keep. This can be any option from any list, or you may choose to keep the entire first paragraph of your Gear section. You may choose to keep Gear you gained through other means, such as through Fellowship moves or other players sharing it with you. You do not need to pick Companions to keep them, as your Bonds will carry over anyway, but choosing a Companion Gear option will let them return to you when you <em>Recover</em>.</li><li>Choose two more Things to keep from your old playbook. These Things can be any of the following: a Gear option, a Core Move, a Custom Move, or a Stat. Gear options follow the same rules as step 4, and Moves follow the same rules as step 3. If you keep a Stat, then that stat is locked in place and does not change in step 6.</li><li>Make a level 1 character with the playbook you chose earlier. They are the same as a level 1 character in all ways, except they get to keep everything from steps 1-5, they do not pick new initial Bonds, and they keep all Companions they already had Bonds with.</li></ol><p>If your Bonds are no longer legal (for example, you switched from Squire and don't have Fast Friends anymore, or you switched into Harbinger and are now limited to 1 Bond per person), choose and erase any illegal Bonds now.</p><p>Do not be dismayed about starting over at level 1. You should still be on par with most other players in strength even with this setback, and since the lowest level characters must be chosen to level up from the <em>End of Session</em> move, you will quickly get back on even footing with everyone else. This is an opportunity to grow and try new things, as well as a way to extend your campaign as the level limit is approached.</p><p><strong>When you reach level 5 with your new playbook,</strong> you will be able to choose a new Destiny. You may even choose this one, if you wish to start again, again.</p><h2>The Ascended</h2><p>You have become more than you once were, more than anyone should ever be. You will gain truly unparalleled power, but at what cost?</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You have taken a Source of Power for yourself.</p><p>The Ascended starts with either <em>Inconceivable Truth</em> or <em>Infinite Power</em>. You have also become a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>, and the Overlord can always sense where you are now, no matter where you go or what you do.</p><h4>Inconceivable Truth</h4><p>You gain an Overlord Stat, write it now. An Overlord Stat does not have a number attached to it, it can be damaged like all of your other stats, and it is an unbreakable truth about you. When it is undamaged, it is true; when it is damaged, it is false. Your Overlord Stat is yours to define however you like. See Overlord Stats on page 180 for more information.</p><p>You can no longer <em>Command Lore</em> about your people - you have left them behind, and they are alien to you now. The lore you have already committed to truth will not change, but you have no more to say about them. The Overlord now Commands Lore about the people you have left behind.</p><h4>Infinite Power</h4><p>The power flows through your veins, more power than you ever imagined possible. When you unleash the massive power contained within you, you may take two damage to destroy anything that isn't a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>. Tell us what this means and what this looks like.</p><p>This power comes with a cost. You lose the Agenda <strong>Improve The World Around You</strong>. Replace it with the Agenda <strong>Show Off Your Power</strong>, as you cannot be convinced there is anything greater than what you can now accomplish.</p><h3>Ascended Advancement</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from this list or your basic playbook's Advancement list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</li><li>Take a Custom Move from any other Destiny.</li><li>Take an Ascended Custom.</li><li>Take an Ascended Custom.</li><li>Take an Ascended Custom.</li></ul><h3>Ascended Custom Moves</h3><h4>Invincible Soul</h4><p><strong>When you would get Taken Out,</strong> heal 2 damage instead. This does not stop the Overlord from making you <em>An Offer You Can't Refuse</em>.</p><p><strong>When the Overlord makes you </strong><em><strong>An Offer You Can't Refuse</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you will always accept, but your power is great enough that you may negotiate. Add a caveat of your choosing to their terms.</p><h4>Unparalleled Skill</h4><p><strong>When you take damage in Melee combat,</strong> you may immediately deal damage back. Ranged attacks cannot hit you - you will always dodge or deflect them, if it is remotely possible for you to do so.</p><p>This Move doesn't work against a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>.<br />You can no longer work together with anyone else. <em>The Bonds That Bind Us</em> no longer bind you, and you cannot give or receive Hope with the Move.</p><h4>Unstoppable Force</h4><p>You never take the 6- result to <em>Overcome</em>, <em>Keep Them Busy</em>, or <em>Get Away</em>. <strong>When you roll a 6- on those Moves,</strong> act as though you rolled a 7.</p><p>You can no longer compromise, retreat, or surrender, for any reason. <strong>When you take a course of action,</strong> you become completely committed to it.</p><h4>Untouchable Beauty</h4><p>Nothing can leave its mark upon you, not anymore. You do not suffer the ravages of time, your wounds never scar, your form cannot be changed, and you cannot be touched or held by another (although you may hold or touch them).</p><p>You no longer relate to those around you, and your Bonds weaken. You can never have more than one Bond with anyone. Erase your extra Bonds now.</p><h2>The Chosen One</h2><p><em>Somehow, it seems like everything's fallen onto your shoulders. You didn't ask for this, but you're here, and no one else is. Rise up, Chosen One.</em></p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Everyone agrees that you're plot important to success.</p><p>The Chosen One starts with the Move <em>Destiny Child</em>.</p><h4>Destiny Child</h4><p>You never need to pay a price when facing a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>. You can also <em>Command Lore</em> about the various prophecies and legends about you, letting us know more details as they become important.</p><p>You gain the Doom stat at +2, if you did not have it already.<br /><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em><strong> by relying on fate or luck,</strong> roll +Doom. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> their fate is sealed.</p><h3>Chosen One Advancement</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from this list or your basic playbook's Advancement list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Increase one of your stats by +1, to a maximum of +3.</li><li>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</li><li>Take a Chosen One Custom.</li><li>Take a Chosen One Custom.</li><li>Take a Chosen One Custom.</li></ul><h3>Chosen One Custom Moves</h3><h4>Ancient Allies</h4><p><strong>When you awaken an ancient enemy of the Overlord to aid your cause,</strong> they will always be willing to help you. They are capable of holding off a <strong>Threat to the World</strong> by themselves, for as long as you need them to. Choose two consequences for calling upon them for aid:</p><ul><li>You and your people will owe an equal favor in return.</li><li>They are slow to take action, and you will need to buy them time.</li><li>They cannot travel, and you'll need to lure the threat to them.</li><li>Re-awakening them will have disastrous consequences later.</li></ul><h4>But the Prophecy!? (Courage)</h4><p><strong>When you act against the prophecies,</strong> roll +Courage.<br /><strong>On a 7+,</strong> you have changed the future. Tell us one part of the Prophecy that has changed and what will happen now as a result.</p><p><strong>On a 9-,</strong> breaking causality has consequences. The Overlord will tell you one way that defying the Prophecy has changed things for the worse.</p><h4>Endless Determination</h4><p><strong>When you get Taken Out,</strong> heal your Courage stat.

This does not stop the Overlord from making you <em>An Offer You Can't Refuse</em>.</p><h4>Evil's Heart</h4><p>Your attacks are Necrotic.<br /><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Keep Them Busy</strong></em><strong> through Melee combat,</strong> you may break your weapon to damage them.</p><h4>Infinite Strength</h4><p>You can pick up and lift anything and anyone you can get a firm grip on. Anything and anyone you hold can be used as if it were a weapon with the tags (Melee, Thrown).</p><p><strong>When you break a weapon you hold to power one of your moves,</strong> if that weapon is a person, you deal damage to them instead of breaking them.</p><h3>Sixth Sense</h3><p>You always know when you are being watched or followed.<br /><strong>When you pause to pay attention,</strong> you always know exactly how many people are around you and roughly what direction from you each of them is. This sixth sense will detect people in hiding and even invisible or incorporeal presences, although not their exact locations.</p><h4>Slash and Burn</h4><p><strong>When everything around you is chaos and fire,</strong> you are filled with Hope.</p><h2>The Ur-Dwarf</h2><p><em>You are the platonic ideal of what it means to be a Dwarf, and all of dwarvenkind will remember you, until history itself is gone.</em></p><p><em>Requirements:</em> You have earned the Fellowship of the Dwarves.</p><p>The Ur-Dwarf starts with the Move <em>Mountain Stance</em>.</p><h4>Mountain Stance</h4><p><strong>When you defend a choke point by yourself and resolve to let no one through,</strong> no monster, vehicle, army, boulder, explosion, dragon, Overlord, or elf can get past you, so long as you remain standing and alert.</p><h3>Ur-Dwarf Advancement</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from this list or your basic playbook's Advancement list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Take the Dwarven Core Moves (<em>Clear the Path</em>, <em>People of Stone</em>, and <em>Unbreakable</em>). Your Iron stat is +2. If you already have them, instead increase one of your stats by +1, to a maximum of +3.</li><li>Take a Dwarven Custom.</li><li>Take an Ur-Dwarf Custom.</li><li>Take an Ur-Dwarf Custom.</li><li>Take an Ur-Dwarf Custom.</li></ul><h3>Ur-Dwarf Custom Moves</h3><h4>Dig Too Deep</h4><p><em>Requires: Dig Deep</em><br />You can <em>Clear the Path</em> to create a tunnel through any material, no matter how impossible - steel, lava, diamonds, fog, water, the open sky, a boat, dreams, anything.</p><h4>Foehammer</h4><p><strong>When you could </strong><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em><strong>,</strong> instead of rolling, you may simply destroy something your target holds - their armor, their weapon, their pride, a few of their bones, or something they carry, your choice.</p><h4>Forge Master</h4><p>You are capable of crafting magnificent magical items. It will be expensive and require exotic materials, but it can be done, at great personal cost. <strong>When you forge such an item,</strong> describe what it looks like, tell us what it does, and then choose two:</p><ul><li>It will be extremely precious and dear to you, and you will never let it out of your sight or trust others to touch or use it.</li><li>You give too much of yourself, permanently losing a part of you (a body part, your memories, your ability to hold Bonds with a specific person, or something similarly significant).</li><li>Its creation will rouse envy and greed among other dwarves, humans, and terrible monsters, all of which will seek to take it from you.</li><li>Neither you nor anyone of your line will ever wield, wear, or use this item, lest terrible tragedy strike your people.</li></ul><p><strong>If you have done all of that,</strong> you are now the owner of a unique magic item with a suitably powerful and dramatic ability for the cost put into it.</p><h4>Greed is Eternal</h4><p><em>Requires: Greed is Good</em><br /><strong>When you absolutely must kill them yourself,</strong> you can declare a person's life to be the object of your greed.</p><p><strong>When you choose an object of your greed,</strong> you heal 1 damage.</p><h4>Lord Under the Mountains</h4><p><strong>When you make a demand of someone who respects your toughness and strength,</strong> you may erase a Bond with them to make them do it, no questions asked.</p><h2>The Warlord</h2><p><em>You have become the ruler of the battlefield, the queen of combat, the king of tactics and strategy, and nothing will get in your way.</em></p><p><em>Requirements:</em> You have earned the Fellowship of the Heir's people.</p><p>The Warlord starts with the Move <em>The Warrior's Path</em>.</p><h4>The Warrior's Path</h4><p>Being outnumbered is meaningless to you, as your enemy's movements are easily read and effortlessly thwarted. <strong>When you try to </strong><em><strong>Overcome</strong></em><strong> the harm a Group, a Gang, or an Army would deal to you,</strong> you always take the 10+ result, without rolling.</p><h3>Warlord Advancement</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from this list or your basic playbook's Advancement list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Take the Heir's Core Moves (<em>Royal Treatment</em> and <em>Yes, My Liege</em>). If you already have them, instead increase one of your stats by +1, to a maximum of +3.</li><li>Take an Heir's Custom.</li><li>Take a Warlord Custom.</li><li>Take a Warlord Custom.</li><li>Take a Warlord Custom.</li></ul><h3>Warlord Custom Moves</h3><h4>Invincible General</h4><p>You never take damage from ordinary physical attacks. A <strong>Threat to the World</strong> can still physically harm you, and high powered explosives or artillery can also harm you, but anything short of that is useless.</p><h4>Off With Their Head</h4><p><strong>When you could </strong><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em><strong> with a Melee weapon,</strong> you may choose to kill them instead of rolling.</p><p>If they are the Overlord, you deal damage instead of killing them.</p><h4>The Fellowship's Armies</h4><p>You have taken control of an army. Choose any Companion from the Innocents list that makes sense - you have three Bonds with them, and they gain the Army stat. This means they can only be damaged by Area or Dangerous attacks, and they count as being everywhere in their location at the same time. You don't need to damage their stats to use their Moves - there are enough of them that they can always help you in whatever way they can.</p><h4>To the Gates of Hell Itself</h4><p>Your Companions will never erase their last Bond with you.</p><h4>You Will Not Die This Day</h4><p><strong>When an ally gets Taken Out and you dramatically rush to their side,</strong> you may share words with them, and nothing will interrupt you.</p><p>Afterwards, they choose one:</p><ul><li>The Warlord will get them to safety, taking them out of the scene</li><li>The Warlord can stand and fight, filled with Hope for the rest of the scene</li><li>They get back up, heal 1 damage, and cannot hold Despair for the rest of the scene.</li></ul><h2>The Witch</h2><p><em>Backer Destiny</em><br /><em>When you can conjure hammers at will, every problem starts looking like an eldritch nail.</em></p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You have solved at least 3 problems using Magic when they could have been solved otherwise.</p><p>The Witch starts with one Witch Custom Move of your choosing.</p><h3>Witch Advancement</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> choose an option from this list or your basic playbook's Advancement list, then mark it off. You may only choose each option once. You also increase your Level by 1.</p><ul><li>Increase one of your stats by +1, to a maximum of +3.</li><li>Take a Witch Custom.</li><li>Take a Witch Custom.</li><li>Take a Witch Custom.</li><li>Take a Witch Custom.</li></ul><h3>Witch Custom Moves</h3><h4>Conjurer</h4><p>You can summon or create servants to suit your needs. <strong>When you have need of a Companion,</strong> you may create one to serve you. This takes time and safety to do, and you may only have one conjured Companion at a time. You have the Bond \"My conjurations serve me without question\", and they have a single stat of your choosing (such as Flight, Ironskin, or Run Like The Wind). You may dismiss your Conjuration at any time for any reason.</p><h4>Defying Gravity</h4><p>You have created a magical means to fly. Add your flying equipment to your Gear, and describe what it looks like. As long as you have your gear, you can fly for as long and as often as you'd like. This can be used as an Advantage.</p><h4>Potion's Master</h4><p><strong>When you could </strong><em><strong>Fill Your Belly</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you may instead spend 1 Food to brew a potion. It has 1 Use when brewed, and a potion's effects are never permanent. You can create a basic Healing potion (1 Use, Healing), or something a bit more unusual. <strong>When making an unusual potion,</strong> describe what it looks like, tell us what it does, and then choose two:</p><ul><li>It gets the imbiber Drunk</li><li>It is a cream and must be applied properly; it is Slow</li><li>It is expensive - Spend 1 Use of anything to finish it</li><li>It has a weird side effect, which you'll find out about when you drink it</li></ul><h4>Stitched Together</h4><p><strong>When you sew up a dying or recently dead body and breathe some magic into it,</strong> they return to life, whether they like it or not. You gain a Bond with them, and they are both living and dead.</p><h4>Turn You into a Newt</h4><p><strong>When you wish to conjure a hex upon them,</strong> state the full name of someone you can see and the reason for your curse. Hexes are narrative - tell us what they lose and what they gain (such as losing arms to gain wings, or losing claws to gain suction cups, or losing the ability to speak to gain gills).</p><p>Your hexes always end at dawn's first light. Hexes never work on a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>. <strong>If you try to use a hex against another player,</strong> they may always attempt to <em>Overcome</em> your hex after you tell them what it is. Your hexes can never be directly lethal, such as taking away someone's ability to breathe. Otherwise, your hexes always work every time.</p><h4>Witch's Familiar</h4><p>You have a Bond with a Familiar you have created. Bonds you have with your Familiar cannot be broken, and you do not need to damage your Familiar to use the Move <em>Bound In Service</em> with them.</p><p><strong>Familiar:</strong> A small animal-like creature created to serve you. It looks like it was plucked from your dreams; describe it. It can share its senses with you, speak your languages, and function in your place in diplomatic matters.<br /><strong>Stats:</strong> Shared Senses, Social Stand-In</p>"

        "content": "<h2>The Overlord Playbook</h2><p>The Overlord is not like the other playbooks in Fellowship. One player will always need to play as the Overlord. This player has a different role than the others - while everyone else is a member of the fellowship, attempting to save the world, you play as the Overlord trying to destroy it. You also have final say in most aspects of the world - you tell the fellowship about the problems in their path, and present new complications when things go wrong. Your job is to keep the game interesting, and keep the game flowing, and make sure everyone has fun playing.</p><p>If that sounds like a lot of work, it can be! Being the Overlord requires a good knack for improv comedy, a solid understanding of all the game's rules, and a bit of creativity. This chapter contains everything you need to know, and will give you plenty of tips and tricks for playing the Overlord well.</p><ul><li>The Overlord has their own Principles and Agendas, different from those of the fellowship.</li><li>The Overlord never needs to roll dice to use their Moves. Only the fellowship needs dice - your moves simply happen when you use them.</li><li>The Overlord also has several Cuts they can use, whether or not the Overlord themselves is around. These are Cuts in the story-telling sense, and they give the Overlord the ability to shape the world around the fellowship at all times during their journey. <strong>When they look to you for what happens next,</strong> make a Cut.</li><li>The Overlord uses the same rules for Leveling Up that the fellowship does. When deciding who the highest level character is, the Overlord is included in the count, and cannot be chosen to <em>Level Up</em> if they are higher level than anyone in the fellowship.</li><li>The Overlord does not have the same stats as the fellowship. Instead, they have unique stats of your own design, that describe immutable truths about your Overlord. Your goal is to gain more stats and grow stronger, and the fellowship's goal is to remove your stats so they can stop you.</li><li>You do not need to be present to influence the game. Your character will spend most of their time off-screen, doing other things. While you're away, you will inform the fellowship about the world around them, and present them with threats to overcome on their journey.</li><li>You are not going to win. At the end of the day, the fellowship should succeed in their journey. But you need to make them fight for it, and there should definitely be some heroic sacrifices along the way.</li></ul><h2>The Overlord</h2><p><em>They have formed a fellowship. They believe it will be enough to stop me. I cannot wait to see them try. It will be delicious, seeing the best this world has to offer fall before my feet.</em></p><p><em>This world is mine, to do with as I please. I am the Overlord, and all things will bow down to me.</em></p><h3>Names</h3><p><strong>Choose one or two from each list, or make up your own:</strong></p><h4>Names:</h4><p><em>Arendhel, Boros, Chryos, Drax, Evinscor, Fell One, Glory, Helmaroc, Indignate, Jrell, Karok, Limitless, Moroth, Numenta, Osiris, Palindros, Quelaaga, Rita, Sauren, Tenebrios, Ursula, Vincent, Waxwell, Xavier, Zanadu</em></p><h4>Titles:</h4><p><em>The Nightmare, Blightwrought, Immortan, From The Moon, The Great Corruptor, Unspeakable One, Iron General, The Fallen King, Shadow Queen, Of Winter's End, The Invader, From Beyond, The Zealot, That Which Was Once Known, Dire Beast</em></p><h3>Look</h3><p><em>Choose one or two from each list, or make up your own:</em></p><ul><li>Glowing Eyes, Cold Eyes, or Otherworldly Eyes</li><li>Imposing Armor, Expensive Clothes, or Monstrous Body</li><li>Impossibly Pretty, Impossibly Buff, or Unassuming Figure</li><li>Menacing Aura, Commanding Attitude, or Insane Laughter</li></ul><h3>Overlord's Principles</h3><p>Your Principles are the rules you play by while running the game. Do not break them. The Principles are discussed more in depth starting on page 192.</p><ul><li>Create problems, not solutions.</li><li>Address the characters, not the players.</li><li>Embrace the fantastic.</li><li>Make a Cut that follows.</li><li>Never speak the name of your Cut.</li><li>Ask questions, use the answers.</li><li>Be a fan of their characters.</li><li>Pass the Spotlight.</li><li>Think dangerous.</li><li>Begin and end with the fiction.</li><li>Think off-screen, too.</li><li>Don't shut them down.</li><li>Be the referee.</li></ul><h3>Basic Cuts</h3><p>Your Cuts are your options - they're what you actually do to play the game. These Cuts are available to you at all times, whether the Overlord is present or not. <strong>When the players look to you for what happens next,</strong> make a Cut. The Cuts are discussed more in depth starting on page 196.</p><ul><li>Reveal an unwelcome truth.</li><li>Show signs of an approaching threat.</li><li>Deal damage.</li><li>Use up or take away their resources.</li><li>Turn their move back on them.</li><li>Separate them.</li><li>Put someone on the spot.</li><li>Present an opportunity.</li><li>Show a downside.</li><li>Tell them the consequences or requirements.</li></ul><h3>Overlord's Agenda</h3><p>Your Agendas are your guidelines for good play. The Overlord has the following Agendas:</p><ul><li><strong>Create Opportunities To Do Good</strong> - the world is filled with people who need the help of the fellowship. Give them people to save. Give them a broken world and see how they fix it.</li><li><strong>Play To Find Out What Happens</strong> - the world is constantly changing and you can never truly know what's going to happen next. Roll with it. Let the game evolve naturally, with everyone's input. Don't plan anything more than what your Overlord is doing.</li><li><strong>Further Agenda</strong> - The Overlord also chooses a unique Agenda. Stick to it.</li></ul><h3>Your Agenda</h3><p>The Overlord is on a mission, and they must complete it. Each of the following options gives you an Agenda to follow and an extra Cut that you can use any time you get to make a Cut.</p><p>Your Agenda gives you an over-arching goal, a rough outline for what you should be doing and why. The players will constantly be running across the aftermath of your plans throughout their adventure - be sure to make it consistent with your Agendas. As long as the tragedy or change will further your Agendas, you can justify any event or calamity happening.</p><p><strong>When the players go somewhere you've caused trouble,</strong> make sure it is immediately apparent. Let them know that something's wrong, and how things have been changed by your power. Let them see the consequences of letting you run amok, and then see what they do about it.</p><p><strong>Choose one:</strong> Ultimate Power, Watch the World Burn, or World is Mine.</p><h4>Ultimate Power</h4><p>You need a lot of power, and you will use any means necessary to get it. You are recruiting wizards, drawing on fonts of power, gathering leylines, training constantly - anything and everything to get just a bit more juice. You pursue great artifacts of power, and destroy or hide anything that may be able to stop you.</p><p><strong>Examples in media:</strong> Nox from <em>Wakfu</em>, Freiza from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, <em>Emperor Palpatine</em> from <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Lord Boros</em> or <em>Garou</em> from <em>One Punch Man</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Extra Cut:</strong> Show signs of the Overlord's increasing power.</em><br />Every time they go somewhere you've been, let them know it. Remnants of your rituals are left behind. The collateral damage gets worse every time they come across a place you've fought in. Make more and more impressive shows of power as the campaign goes on. Every time they see you, be worse than last time.</p><p><em><strong>Agenda:</strong> Place wonderful things in jeopardy.</em><br />To gain your power, you must take it from that which has power. Find the wonderful things in this world - the great dragons, the elven homelands, the dwarven treasures, the orcish hivemother, anything of great importance is in your sights. Put them in jeopardy, threaten to destroy or change them forever. And then follow through with it.</p><h4>World is Mine</h4><p>You will conquer these lands and unite them under your rule. You attack nations directly, usurp leaders, overthrow kingdoms. You're here to take over the world. Your minions will stay behind in your wake, patrolling and controlling conquered territories. You lay siege to their great cities, capture their rulers, and corrupt their politicians.</p><p><strong>Examples in media:</strong> Ganondorf from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, Firelord Ozai from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, Sauron from <em>The Lord Of The Rings</em>, Immortan Joe from <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Extra Cut:</strong> Expand the Overlord's grasp.</em></p><p>Show them just how far your power stretches. Tell them about another land, conquered by your armies. Show them where your armies march next. Tell them about another conquered city, another lost battalion, another defeated ally. Your reach always presses onward.</p><p><em><strong>Agenda:</strong> Portray a world on the edge of defeat.</em><br />The world hangs in the balance, and your side is winning. The world looks more and more like it will fall into rank beneath your command with every passing month. If the fellowship fails, they know what will happen, because you won't let them miss what your rule looks like. Show a world under the Overlord's power, where everything outside of your grasp has to actively fight to stay that way.</p><h4>Watch the World Burn</h4><p>Your game plan is simple: carnage and fear. You cause as much damage and chaos as you can, in whatever way it hurts the most. You play malevolent pranks on the weak, cause great calamities just for kicks, and concoct elaborate plans just to watch the world fall apart around them.</p><p><strong>Examples in media:</strong> <em>The Joker</em> from <em>The Dark Knight</em>, DIO from <em>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders</em>, Skullkid from <em>Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</em>, Lord Dominator from <em>Wander Over Yonder</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Extra Cut:</strong> Leave chaos in the Overlord's wake.</em><br />When the players see where you've been, show chaos. Show collateral damage. Show families torn asunder, show the effects of terrible curses and crimes, show the fellowship just how bad you can be. Where the Overlord goes, pain follows.</p><p><em><strong>Agenda:</strong> Fill the world with strange and painful events.</em><br />The world is a weird place, and weird things happen in it. Show them unexplainable things, painful things, terrible things, wonderful things. The world is filled with confusion, the world is filled with wonder, the world is filled with the strange and the painful. Show them all of it.</p><h3>Overlord's Basic Moves</h3><p>The Overlord and their Generals have all of these moves.</p><h4>An Offer You Can't Refuse</h4><p><strong>When a player gets Taken Out in your presence,</strong> you may give them an offer, for their services, for something they hold, or for the end of their life. They may attempt to negotiate, but you do not need to listen. <strong>If they accept,</strong> you fulfill the deal and then leave the scene. <strong>If they refuse,</strong> they must roll + Courage.</p><p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> you are too terrifying, and they take your offer, against their true desires. <strong>On a 7-9,</strong> they refuse, and they have one good chance to spite you. They will tell you how. Then, you will tell them what you do to them for it. You may kill them for this.</p><p><strong>On a 10+,</strong> not only do they spite you, but they manage to escape before you can properly punish them for it, ending the scene with you standing there, alone. Tell us of your rage.</p><h4>Chew The Scenery</h4><p><strong>When you are physically present,</strong> you can have the Spotlight for as long as you like, when you get it. You and your Generals can never be in Despair.</p><h4>Forge a Bond</h4><p>The Overlord does not make friends. <strong>When you cause great personal harm to someone or their people,</strong> <em>Forge a Bond</em> with them. Your Bonds can only be erased by your own Moves, and you can hold any number of Bonds.</p><p><strong>When you reveal a side of yourself to someone you never intended to share it with,</strong> they may <em>Forge a Bond</em> with you. You cannot erase the Bonds they hold with you, no matter how badly you might want to.</p><h4>Heart of Fire</h4><p><strong>When a player has a Bond with your name in it,</strong> you do not become their Companion, but it still holds sway over you. They may erase that Bond with you at any time to buy themselves reprieve. They choose one: You will show them mercy, tell them something valuable, or ignore them for the time being.</p><h4>Heart of Iron</h4><p><strong>When someone makes a move against you,</strong> you may erase a Bond with them to have them automatically fail their roll, steal the Spotlight from them, and <em>Twist the Knife</em> against them. Your attention is entirely upon them while you use this move - the rest of the fellowship can act without drawing your attention. A player may force you to do this before making their roll.</p><h4>Threat to the World</h4><p>You threaten the world and all it stands for. As a <strong>Threat To The World</strong>, you have immunity to a variety of moves.</p><p><strong>When someone who is not also a Threat to the World takes direct action against something that is,</strong> they must Pay a Price to do so.</p><h4>Twist the Knife</h4><p><strong>When you speak to someone you have a Bond with about your history with them,</strong> you may force them to relive their pain. They must either pay a price, stand down and get out of your way, or attack you, right now, their choice. No matter what they choose, you make a Hard Cut against them.</p><h3>Overlord's Core</h3><p>Only the Overlord has these moves.</p><h4>Overlord Stats</h4><p>Your stats are not quite the same as the stats of the fellowship. Your stats are statements of truth about you, which you write in yourself. While they are undamaged, they are true - you are Invincible, or you are Made Of Fire. While they are damaged, they are not true - you can be harmed, or your touch does not burn them.</p><p>You begin the game with three stats of your own choosing. An Overlord Stat is a word or short phrase describing your power, with a short sentence explaining it further.</p><p>You can write anything you like, but here's some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Charming:</strong> No one but the fellowship believes you are dangerous or evil.</li><li><strong>Flight:</strong> The ground cannot hold you.</li><li><strong>Invincible:</strong> You cannot be hurt.</li><li><strong>Juggernaut:</strong> You can lift, throw, and break anything you can touch.</li><li><strong>Made Of Fire:</strong> Your touch burns and scars them.</li><li><strong>Mythical:</strong> No one but the fellowship believes you are real/still alive.</li><li><strong>Phantom:</strong> You can pass through walls, people, and attacks.</li><li><strong>Rich:</strong> You can buy anyone and anything that can be bought.</li><li><strong>Terrifying:</strong> Where you go, no one holds Hope.</li><li><strong>Unknowable:</strong> No one knows your plans or your next course of action.</li><li><strong>Untouchable:</strong> None can touch or hold you.</li><li><strong>Warrior:</strong> You are unbeatable in combat.</li></ul><p>The fellowship knows each of your stats, and they will need to form a counter-plan against every single one of them. Your undamaged stats are immutable truths that cannot be contradicted by any means.</p><p><strong>When you Advance your Plans,</strong> you may heal a damaged stat instead.<br /><strong>When you Advance your Plans,</strong> you may swap an undamaged Overlord stat for a new Overlord stat. Write the new stat now.</p><p><strong>When you seize a new Source of Power,</strong> gain a new stat of your choice. <strong>When you gain or lose a Source of Power,</strong> write down which stat that Source of Power is tied to - if you lose or regain that Source of Power in the future, it takes the stat with it.</p><p>You can start the game with as many as three Sources of Power, or as few as zero. Which of your stats is tied to which Source of Power is not mentioned until the Source takes that stat from you, either from the fellowship using a new Source of Power against you or taking away a Source of Power you were drawing power from.</p><p>Sources of Power are mythical locations, items, or creatures that you draw your strength from. They may be something you carry, like a magic ring, or a cursed crown, or suit of armor. They may be something you must protect, like a power core, or a mystical tree, or a control tower. Or they may be something you must hide, like the last ghost in the world, or your soul gem, or your family. Whatever it is, as long as you have it, you are powerful.</p><h4>Overlord Damage</h4><p>You are difficult to harm, but it isn't impossible. <strong>When you would take damage,</strong> they must first pay a price for each undamaged stat you have. <strong>If you would be destroyed,</strong> instead damage one of your stats at no cost to your attacker. <strong>If you take damage or are destroyed while none of your stats remain,</strong> you are finally defeated, once and for all. There is no coming back for you.</p><p>Your supreme power also comes with some downsides. Most notably, they can harm you without ever being near you. <strong>If the fellowship seizes a Source of Power,</strong> they may use it to erase one of your stats forever. You can never get that stat back unless you can take control of that Source of Power.</p><p><strong>When the fellowship </strong><em><strong>Recovers</strong></em><strong>,</strong> heal one of your damaged stats.</p><h4>Cut Them Real Bad</h4><p><strong>When you are physically present,</strong> your Cuts can be as hard as you like.</p><h4>Master Plan</h4><p>The Overlord has a basic plan for what to do with this world, but you do not need to know all of the details. The fellowship can attempt to learn your plans, but this should require them to capture a General, undertake a sneaking mission, or earn it through great peril.</p><p>You begin the game with two New Plans: write down a source of power you wish to seize, and a community you wish to destroy. All plans start at stage 0.</p><p><strong>Whenever the fellowship </strong><em><strong>Recovers</strong></em><strong> or the Overlord Levels Up,</strong> you Advance your Plans. <strong>When the fellowship has A Little Downtime,</strong> you may Advance your Plans during your turn, but the fellowship will immediately hear about it if you do. <strong>When you could Advance your Plans,</strong> you may recruit a new General or heal one damaged Overlord Stat instead.</p><p><strong>When you Advance your Plans,</strong> you choose one of them and move it one step forward. You will always have two plans going at once - whenever you have only one plan left, write a second new plan immediately.<br />0) <strong>Create a new plan:</strong> Name a Source of Power you wish to seize, or a community you wish to destroy, and write it down.</p><ol><li><strong>Begin the plan:</strong> Your forces move into position to act upon your plan. At this point, the fellowship hears that you are up to something, but not what you are doing or where your forces are.</li><li><strong>Execute the plan:</strong> Your forces take action. The fellowship hears about what you are up to, but stopping you now would be very difficult.</li><li><strong>Victory:</strong> You seize the source of power, or destroy the named community. A destroyed community no longer grants Fellowship.</li></ol><p><strong>When you could Advance Your Plans,</strong> you may instead do one of the following: heal a damaged Overlord stat, recruit a General, or swap an undamaged Overlord stat for a new one. Write the new stat now.</p><h4>My Only Weakness!</h4><p><strong>You have a Weakness:</strong> There is a single material, item, charm, ritual, or spell that you are vulnerable to. This is your Weakness. Write it down.</p><p>The other players will know your Weakness, but the fellowship they are playing as does not. Unless they have something that tells them your Weakness, they will need to discover it through play.</p><p><strong>When you are exposed to your Weakness,</strong> one of your stats is immediately damaged, their choice. Your stats and your moves cannot protect you from your Weakness, but it can only hurt you once per scene.</p><h4>Overlord Foibles</h4><p>There is always a catch, when it comes to having unstoppable power.<br />You have some quirks that the fellowship can exploit. You have all of the following vulnerabilities:</p><ul><li><strong>You are arrogant:</strong> Every setback is minor and can be dealt with. Everything is fine and you know you cannot lose.</li><li><strong>You are busy:</strong> The fellowship's destruction is not your actual goal. You have something you want, and your focus is on getting that. When you personally engage the fellowship, you goal is not to kill them all, but to get them out of your way while you do your thing.</li><li><strong>You are honor bound:</strong> When you make a promise, you will always keep it, even against your better interests. This weakness may seem silly, but it makes for a better game when you can negotiate or gamble with the fellowship and they can trust you to keep your end of the deal.</li></ul><h4>Your Generals</h4><p>You have a General at your command who follows your every whim. To create a General, take any Threat you like from Chapter 7 and give it the <strong>Threat to the World</strong> trait. Your Generals follow you without question and can never become Companions to the fellowship. Generals have all of your Basic Moves and their own minions. You have one Bond with each of your Generals, describing why they serve you.</p><p><strong>If one of your Generals suffers a significant failure at the fellowship's hands,</strong> you will either execute them, exile them, or give them one last chance. You can only give a General one last chance once.</p><p>You begin the game with a single General.<br /><strong>When you Advance your Plans,</strong> you may recruit a new General instead.</p><h3>Choose Overlord's Armies</h3><p>Choose the option that best represents your people. The option you choose gives you access to that category of enemies in the Overlord's Toolbox, to serve you and do your bidding in whatever ways you'd like. You may still use the options you do not choose to threaten the fellowship, but only sparingly, and they do not serve the Overlord.</p><ul><li><strong>The Horde</strong></li></ul><p>Your armies are endless, swarming wherever you need them. This army is simply massive, as each enemy is its own swarm or group of enemies, before you even get into Groups or Gangs. Nothing can escape their swarming numbers.</p><ul><li><strong>The Organization</strong></li></ul><p>You have an elite group whose membership mirrors that of the fellowship, but corrupted or twisted. The Organization does not form a proper army, and your forces are basically a large group of mini-bosses. They will compete with the fellowship in a rivalry fashion, racing them to Sources of Power and trying to undermine the fellowship's plans.</p><ul><li><strong>The Scourge</strong></li></ul><p>You and your armies spread corruption and blight, and those tainted by it join you and your cause. Tell us how your blight spreads, and what it looks like. Your blight leaves corrupted zones, corrupted creatures, and undead warriors wherever it touches.</p><ul><li><strong>The Titans</strong></li></ul><p>Your armies are small in number, but not in stature. Your forces are massive titans, nearly unbeatable without heavy firepower and teamwork. Your army is easily avoided and run away from, but only the heaviest of fortifications and the strongest of armies will slow them, and nothing can stop them.</p><h3>Overlord's Gear</h3><p>You do not need to eat, and you do not want for companions. <strong>When the fellowship </strong><em><strong>Recovers</strong></em><strong>,</strong> you also recover your Gear.</p><p><strong>Choose your weapons, as many as you need:</strong></p><ul><li>An elegant sword, exotic in design (Melee)</li><li>A massive weapon, larger than anyone else could wield (Melee)</li><li>Your bare hands, able to crush stone or pierce metal (Melee)</li><li>Magical bolts of energy, able to be reflected back at you (Ranged)</li><li>Destructive blasts of fire or lightning (Dangerous)</li></ul><p><strong>Choose two defenses:</strong></p><ul><li>A clever plan (1 Use). Use this to reveal a trap or escape route just as you make use of it.</li><li>A powerful special attack (1 Use). Be sure to name it! You can Use this instead of erasing a Bond to trigger Heart of Iron.</li><li>A trick up your sleeve (Useful, 1 Use). Use this to produce anything you could possibly need, right now.</li><li>A traitor (1 Use). Use this to make anyone in the scene who is not a part of the fellowship reveal their allegiance to you, complete with a dramatic moment where they betray the fellowship and cause them trouble.</li></ul><p><strong>Choose the secret reason you're doing all of this. You do not have to tell the fellowship your choice.</strong></p><ul><li>You have a sympathetic backstory of loss and tragedy. It does not justify your actions, except to yourself. You gain a Bond with anyone who listens to some of your backstory, but they also gain a Bond with you.</li><li>It is not you who does all this, but something that is controlling you - a dark master in the shadows, an evil artifact corrupting whoever holds it, or an even greater threat you are simply trying to destroy yourself. <strong>When the fellowship defeats you,</strong> reveal this new threat. It's their problem now.</li><li>You are a part of a recurring cycle, and you know you are destined to be defeated. If you could only convince the fellowship to listen to you, maybe you could break the cycle once and for all... But heroes never listen to you.</li><li>You don't have a secret. You're just an evil jerk with way too much power.</li></ul><h3>Initial Bonds</h3><p>You start with one Bond with each member of the fellowship. Each member of the fellowship writes their name into one of these Bonds:</p><p>I destroyed ______ 's hometown.<br />I have caused great harm to ______ 's people.<br />I killed someone important to ______ .<br />______ killed someone important to me.<br />______ knows the details of my previous defeat.<br />______ 's people serve me now.<br />Only ______ knows my Weaknesses.<br />I have fought ______ before, and left a wound upon them. It burns in my presence.<br />______ was once my friend.<br />______ secretly admires me and the things I do.</p><p>You have one Bond with each of your Generals. Write a Bond describing why they serve you or your relationship with them.</p><h3>Overlord's Custom</h3><p>You do not start with any custom Moves, and you must gain them by leveling up.</p><h4>And in the Darkness, Bind Them</h4><p>You have crafted an item of power. Choose one of your Overlord stats, then give this item of power to one of your Generals. Whoever holds this item of power also has that Overlord stat.</p><p><strong>If any of the fellowship gets their hands on it,</strong> they gain all the power that it brings, but it will also fill their mind with dark thoughts. They gain the <strong>Agenda: Spread Chaos</strong> while they hold the item of power.</p><h4>Destroy Trust</h4><p><strong>When you dismiss, mock, or show how weak the Bond two people share is,</strong> erase those Bonds.</p><h4>Evil's Touch</h4><p>Damage dealt by you and your Generals is Necrotic. <strong>When you or your Generals damage a Companion,</strong> you may destroy them instead. Tell us what this looks like and what this means.</p><h4>Fear Me!</h4><p><strong>When you menace someone,</strong> they will always do as you say or run in terror, their choice. <strong>When you use this Move on someone in the fellowship,</strong> they may pay a price to prevent this Move from working on them for the rest of the scene.</p><h4>Heart of Ice</h4><p><strong>When you deal damage to someone you have a Bond with or who has a Bond with you,</strong> make another Hard Cut against them immediately. This extra Cut cannot be <em>deal damage</em>.</p><h4>Mastermind</h4><p>You now have three Master Plans at once instead of two. Write a new plan immediately, then advance all of your current plans one step.</p><h4>No More Games</h4><p><strong>When you next face off against the fellowship,</strong> as soon as the talking is done, one of them is immediately Taken Out (ask for a volunteer). They take damage to all of their stats and they are out for the rest of the scene. The rest of the fellowship cannot oppose you this scene, and you get away with what you want before taunting them and leaving. <strong>After you use this Move once,</strong> it is gone forever.</p><h4>Now Who Told You That?</h4><p><strong>When the players use your Weakness against you,</strong> erase that Weakness and choose a new one. The old Weakness was either lies and misinformation, or you have grown past it and it no longer harms you as it once did. <strong>After you use this Move once,</strong> it is gone forever.</p><h4>Team Rocket</h4><p>Choose up to three minions from your Army and name them. <strong>When working as a group,</strong> they cannot be damaged or destroyed - whenever one of them would be, they all retreat from the scene. This group will tenaciously follow the fellowship for the rest of the campaign, informing you of where they are and what they've done recently.</p><p><strong>If the fellowship recruits them as Companions,</strong> it is only temporary: you can erase all Bonds the fellowship holds with them at any time.</p><h4>Warmonger</h4><p>Choose another option from the Overlord's Armies list. You have acquired that army as well.</p><h4>You've Met With A Terrible Fate, Haven't You?</h4><p><strong>When a player gets Taken Out in your presence,</strong> you may leave a curse upon them instead of making <em>An Offer They Can't Refuse</em>. Tell us the nature of this curse, and what must be done to lift it. <strong>Whatever curse you give them,</strong> it cannot stop them from continuing to play as their character unless they want a new one. <strong>After you use this Move once,</strong> it is gone forever.</p><h3>Overlord's Advancement</h3><p><strong>When you </strong><em><strong>Level Up</strong></em><strong>,</strong> increase your level by 1, then do all of the following:</p><ul><li>Choose one: Gain an Overlord Custom or recruit a General, gaining a Bond with them immediately.</li><li><em>Forge a Bond</em> with anyone, fellowship or otherwise. The Bond you write is an immutable truth about them, and you can <em>Command Lore</em> about anyone you have a Bond with who is not a part of the fellowship.</li><li>Advance your plans (see the Overlord Basic Move <em>Master Plan</em>).</li></ul><h1>Playing Overlord</h1><p>It is extremely important to note that you are not playing this game to kill the players. The fellowship are a nuisance, but they were formed to counter the Overlord, not the other way around. The Overlord has a game plan, something they are already doing. Killing the fellowship does not help you. Immediately going after the players solves nothing and does not help you. Killing their characters just because you can doesn't make for a good game, and let's be honest here, it would be very easy for the Overlord to do that if killing the fellowship was their goal.</p><p>But it isn't. The Overlord has other things to do. They have people to see, places to conquer, cities to burn. Make the players hunt you down. Make them come to you. Sometimes, they should catch you. They should find you, and maybe you will fight, or maybe you won't. But you have no reason to try to kill them yet. You have better things to do and places to be, and unless they really won't let you leave, you have no reason to go for the kill.</p><p>Of course, they're going to become a serious problem eventually. They're going to foil your plans, they're going to get in your way, they're going to weaken you. When something you really wanted to succeed falls apart because of them? When they have defeated your Generals and destroyed your Rune of Invulnerability? Maybe then it's time to take off the kid gloves, and actively hunt them down. Maybe then you'll reconsider how important they are to seeing your plans completed.</p><p>But until then? Not so much. The fellowship are a nuisance, not a threat. Treat them as such. When they become a real threat, when they've toppled every plan you have and you're on your last legs, that's when the Overlord will strike at them full force, for one last climactic showdown. But until that moment, don't do that.</p><h1>Playing Refrere</h1><p>As the Overlord, you are playing as the game's referee. You may control the opposing team, but you are not opposing the fellowship yourself. Think of it like playing a video game - you're the level designer and the enemy AI, rolled into one. Good design isn't about making something to beat your friends with - it's about making something that is satisfying to play against, giving a challenge that isn't too hard or too easy.</p><p>This is where your Principles come in. Your Principles are your rules - <strong>do not break them</strong>. These rules will keep you honest, keep the game going forward, and they exist to make sure everyone has a good time. Commit to them.</p><p>Your <strong>Agendas</strong> are the specific things your Overlord character wants to do. Your Agenda helps you play the Overlord as a goal-driven, task-oriented, successful conqueror of the world. If you ever need to know what the Overlord should be doing next, consult your Agenda.</p><p>And lastly, you have a variety of Cuts at your disposal. Cuts are your story-telling tool for keeping a scene flowing, and you can make a Cut any time there is an opening. Cuts can be either Soft or Hard - a Soft Cut gives the fellowship time to react, but a Hard Cut has already happened. <strong>Whenever the players look to you for what happens next,</strong> make a Soft Cut. Keep the story flowing.</p><h2>Knowing Rules</h2><p>The Overlord themselves doesn't need to use any of the same rules the fellowship does, but it is important for them to know those rules all the same. You don't need to know all of them by heart, but players will miss things, or overlook things, or sometimes, rarely, they will even try to cheat. You're the filter between what they want to do and what finally happens, and having a good understanding of what they will be doing will make the game flow much easier.</p><p>If you are playing with the printable play aids, this is significantly easier to do, since you can always look up the exact rules for any Move at a moment's notice by looking over the print out. You can get those play aids here:<br /><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks\">http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks</a></p><h2>Overlord's Principles</h2><p>Your Principles are the rules you play by while running the game. Do not break them.</p><ul><li><strong>Create problems, not solutions.</strong></li></ul><p>As the Overlord, it is your job to create problems. You make situations worse. You make things harder. And then you leave them be. Don't over-think things, leave some details open to figure out as you go. You never need to think up a solution, that's not what you're here for. You make problems, and then wait for the fellowship to try something.</p><p>If they come up with something plausible, roll with it! Give their ideas value, and give their solutions an honest go. Sometimes they don't work out their Moves will let you know how their attempts go - but it isn't your job to solve problems. Create some problems, and let the fellowship sort it out.</p><ul><li><strong>Address the characters, not the players.</strong></li></ul><p>Nothing takes you out of the game quicker than having the big bad evil overlord call you Nate. That's Bungo Bullroarer to you, Mr. Overlord Sir. Get to know the player's character names, and use them. If you need to write them down for yourself, do it. And if other players start using real names, gently remind them that they're talking to Bungo, and should address him as such.</p><ul><li><strong>Embrace the fantastic.</strong></li></ul><p>The world is an exciting place, filled with crazy and wonderful things. Feel free to run with it. If something sounds completely implausible, impossible, or stupid, ask yourself \"would the game be better if it WERE plausible?\" If you said \"yes,\" then make it so, captain.</p><p>This applies to everything, not just weird fantasy monsters or magic stuff. If the players are traveling by boat and come across a mountain, maybe the river keeps flowing right up it! Or maybe the river cuts through, or maybe their boat was built to go up waterfalls anyway - the elves have been traveling this route for years, so they'd need to build a boat capable of taking the trip, right? It'd be a real short journey otherwise.</p><p>Make the game weird. Make the world interesting. Give everyone a reason to remember something they came across, give them a reason to remember the cities they find, and the people they meet, and the battles they've overcome. Embrace the fantastic.</p><ul><li><strong>Make a Cut that follows.</strong></li></ul><p>When you have the chance to use one of your Cuts, make sure it makes sense in the current situation. Sure, you can <em>Show Signs of an Approaching Threat</em> whenever you want, but that doesn't mean that every time the players fail a roll a bear shows up. Read the situation, figure out what might logically happen next, and make a Cut that makes that happen.</p><p>If you're at a loss for which Cut to pick, ask yourself three questions. Which Cut makes the most sense? Which Cut would cause the most chaos? And which Cut would be the most fun? If two questions have the same answer, do that. If they're all different, pick the one that the situation needs the most logic, chaos, or fun. Then make the Cut that follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Never speak the name of your Cut.</strong></li></ul><p>You have a bunch of Cuts, but they're just abstract envelopes for packaging your events inside of. Don't ever say \"I'm going to <em>Deal Damage</em> now\" or \"I think it's time to <em>Show a Downside</em>\" unless you're playing with a bunch of nerds who really like knowing how the guts of the system work. Even then, you should only mention the name of a Cut sparingly - knowing the guts of the system takes a lot of the magic away, and some players will think that gives them room to try and weasel their way out of what happens next.</p><p>So don't give them that opportunity. Instead, say something like \"The bear's claws dig right into you! You take damage - which stat took the hit?\" or \"The problem with riding a big chufty war-horse is that you're a lot higher up than you'd normally be. You never saw that tree branch coming, and it takes you right off your horse. It runs off without you.\"</p><p>Instead of calling out your Cuts, just say what happens.</p><ul><li><strong>Ask questions, use the answers.</strong></li></ul><p>The players have just as much control over the lore of this world as you do, maybe more. Ask them questions as often as you like, and write down the answers if you don't think you'll remember them later. Come back to them, bring things back, make them relevant. People love it when something they've thought of is useful or important - let their answers be useful and important.</p><ul><li><strong>Be a fan of their characters.</strong></li></ul><p><em>Fellowship</em> is inherently an optimistic setting. The Overlord isn't the only cool player at the table - the other player's characters should be exciting and fun too. Be a fan - love their characters just as much as they do. Let good things happen to them. Let them have their moments in the Spotlight. Give</p><p>them their chance to shine. Make them earn it, of course, but if they aren't having fun then what's the point of playing? Be cool, let them be cool, and give them the opportunity to do cool things.</p><ul><li><strong>Pass the Spotlight.</strong></li></ul><p>The Spotlight is an important concept in a game of <em>Fellowship</em>, because it helps keep everything focused and moving. Make sure the Spotlight doesn't sit on any one player for too long, and try to make sure everyone gets their own time in the Spotlight regularly. Everyone wants a turn to be cool, and as the Overlord, your voice carries the most weight among everyone here.</p><p>Sometimes a scene may come along where the Spotlight will sit on one or two players for quite some time, and that's okay - don't mess with the flow of the scene just to make sure everyone gets an equal turn. But once such a scene is over, it's a good idea to go back and say \"While they were doing that...\" and put the Spotlight on everyone else for a while.</p><p>The Spotlight can be a bit hard to keep track of, and you may not always know when you should pass it or keep it on someone a little longer. Just trust your instincts, for the most part. Try not to pass the Spotlight when they're in the middle of something, but it's perfectly fine to pass the Spotlight during a cliffhanger. Sometimes literally - if a player gets thrown into a bad spot, that's the perfect time to go to someone else and see what they're doing in the meantime. This is a good way to add a little tension to the story with very little effort on your part, and it keeps the game exciting and keeps everyone involved.</p><p>Share the Spotlight, and share it often.</p><ul><li><strong>Think dangerous.</strong></li></ul><p>The world gets bland without a little spice. Never be afraid to ramp up the situation - being in a wagon chase is dangerous and exciting, sure, but when the wagon catches fire, it gets even more dangerous and exciting. Always be on the lookout for ways to ramp up the danger, increase the risk, ratchet up the consequences. It's much more fun, you must confess, with lives on the line. Not yours, of course, but theirs? Well that'll do just fine.</p><p>A lot of the fun of <em>Fellowship</em> is how the situation can always get worse, it can always get crazier, and the heroes can still pull through. Just because you're a fan of their characters doesn't mean you need to hand them life on a silver platter - make them work for it, and make sure it is risky and dangerous work. That thrill of danger is one of the greatest parts of playing a heroic character. Don't deny them that.</p><ul><li><strong>Begin and end with the fiction.</strong></li></ul><p>Start every scene with the fiction - what's going on right now? What's happening, to who, and how are they doing it? What do you sense right now, what do you see and hear? What do you smell, what do you feel, what is going on? Start there, with the facts and the narrative, and then roll into an action either one of your Cuts, or one of their Moves. After someone's done something, go right back into the fiction - figure out what's changed, what's happened, what did that do? Keep going forward, bouncing between the fiction and the mechanics as need be, and keep the game rolling.</p><p>The standard flow of play should always go like this: You make a Cut, and explain what's going on fictionally. The player(s) respond to that Cut, and work with you to find out what happens next in the fiction. Then you go back to start, making another Cut for the players to react to, and on like that, always snowballing forward.</p><ul><li><strong>Think off-screen, too.</strong></li></ul><p>Not every event has to happen right here, right now. Sometimes bad things happen somewhere else, especially when the Overlord isn't around. It's okay to make a Cut where the players don't see the results, especially if things right now are getting a bit too hectic for you to add more to it, or if things are so calm that nothing's going on where they are right now. No matter what the players do, keep in mind that the Overlord is always up to something.</p><ul><li><strong>Don't shut them down.</strong></li></ul><p>A major part of <em>Fellowship</em> is the combined control of the narrative that everyone has together. When a player Commands Lore, you can never say 'no' to the results. When a player proposes something about the world or the current situation, lean towards 'yes' before saying no. If they want to try something, ask them how they do it.</p><p>If they propose something that is just completely ludicrous that you could never allow in your game... even then, don't tell them 'no, that doesn't work.' Instead, talk to them about it, like adults. Find a middle ground. Maybe dial it back a bit, or figure out something else that works instead. This isn't just \"your game,\" this game belongs to everyone sitting at the table with you.</p><p>As the Overlord, it is your job to make the game fun and exciting. It is not your job to police the game and lock it into what you think it should be. And if you are really against something... you can always <em>Tell Them The Consequences or Requirements</em>.</p><ul><li><strong>Be the referee.</strong></li></ul><p>If someone doesn't know which Move to use, tell them. When someone isn't sure how something should work within the rules, tell them. Even if you don't know, tell them. If someone doesn't know which Move to use, have them <em>Overcome</em>. It's quicker to make up an answer and run with it than to waste time looking it up and figuring it out. You're the referee. Make the call.</p><h2>Overlords Cuts</h2><p>A Cut is a story-telling weapon the Overlord wields against the fellowship. Your Cuts are how you actually play the game and tell the story of <em>Fellowship</em>. <strong>When the players look to you for what happens next,</strong> make a Cut.</p><p>Cuts come in two different strengths - Hard Cuts and Soft Cuts. Soft Cuts are the ones you will fall back on most times. Soft Cuts are when you use a Cut, and then before actually doing anything to the players, you ask them \"What do you do?\" You give them a chance to react, you tell them to do something now, and you make the consequences known.</p><p>You should start every scene with a Soft Cut, and you should use a soft cut every time the players look to you for what happens next. When no one knows what is going on, make a Soft Cut.</p><p>A Hard Cut is what happens next. A Hard Cut is what happens when a Soft Cut hits - the demon's fangs bite into your flesh and you take damage, or you fail to stop the out of control carriage and it flies right off the cliff. The Hard Cut is the point where a bad thing has <em>happened</em>, and the players can no longer stop it. If you only ever make Soft Cuts, nothing will actually happen, so bring down that hammer. <strong>Whenever a player fails to stop a Soft Cut,</strong> make a Hard Cut that follows.</p><p><strong>Whenever a player rolls a 6 or less on any roll,</strong> you can make any Cut you have access to, as hard as you want to make it. You can give them a Soft Cut if they need a break, or you can slam them with a Hard Cut and let them deal with the consequences. It's your call.</p><p>You have access to the following Cuts at all times - they are your options, your weapons, your problem-makers. During any given scene, you will also have access to the moves of whatever threats are in the scene, and you have access to your Overlord Moves as well. <strong>Whenever you have an opportunity to make a Cut,</strong> you may use any Cut available to you.</p><p><strong>You always have these Cuts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reveal an unwelcome truth.</strong></li></ul><p>Tell them something they don't want to hear. This Cut can be used to do just about anything, making it the strongest Cut in your arsenal. Literally any news can be bad news, and when you make this Cut, tell them the bad news.</p><p>Some examples of good unwelcome truths:<br />\"The enchanted sword you were looking for is here! And there. And over there. It's been shattered into several pieces.\"<br />\"You threw him right off the cliff! Unfortunately, his hooked sword catches on your belt, pulling you with him.\"<br />\"Well, the good news is, even after that last stunt, your carriage still has all of its wheels! The bad news is, it doesn't have much else anymore. The horse ran off, the walls mostly fell off, and your luggage is somewhere back down the path, scattered all about.\"</p><ul><li><strong>Show signs of an approaching threat.</strong></li></ul><p>Reveal a new problem they'll need to deal with. Enemy reinforcements call in, or you triggered an avalanche, or the Harbinger can feel the Overlord approaching. If you need something to make a situation more perilous, this is your Cut.</p><p>An approaching threat doesn't necessarily need to be a new threat, either. If the players are crossing an old bridge, you could tell them they start to hear the ropes snapping, and they should really hurry up. Or an enemy the Elf had been <em>Keeping Busy</em> finally gets past her, and they're rushing after another player now! This Cut is all about giving them something extra to worry about, on top of whatever they were already dealing with.</p><ul><li><strong>Deal damage.</strong></li></ul><p>This Cut is simple: Hurt them. Deal damage to a stat, either theirs or their Companions'. Damage in <em>Fellowship</em> doesn't need to be physical either. When they become demoralized, when they suffer a setback, when they are in despair, you can also deal damage to them. If the pain is right, you can even take away their Bonds. This Cut is simple: Hurt them.</p><p>Sometimes, you may use this Cut on your own minions or the threats you've put on the table. When the situation is right, if the fellowship takes away an opponent's ability to do something or triggers something harmful, you can damage their stats yourself. It can help to keep things tidy.</p><ul><li><strong>Use up or take away their resources.</strong></li></ul><p>They have Gear for a reason - make them use it. Give them chances to get out of a tight spot by using up their stuff. Damage their Gear with fire or water or enemy attack. Their Gear is valuable, but it is also replaceable. Treat it as such. Make them use it, make them lose it, make them burn it up.</p><ul><li><strong>Turn their Move back on them.</strong></li></ul><p>Not everything goes according to plan. When a player tries something and it goes poorly, turn it back on them. A charging dwarf fails to <em>Clear the Path</em>? Clothesline them, or hit them hard with a counter attack, or have the room collapse around them. The Harbinger casts their mighty spell in tight quarters or around civilians? Have it go wild, causing crazy and disastrous consequences. Heroes are reckless basically all of the time. It should be easy to come up with ways their plans can go wrong.</p><ul><li><strong>Separate them.</strong></li></ul><p>Toss them away from each other. Have rooms collapse or fill with lava. Get the Halfling kidnapped by treefolk. The fellowship is at their strongest when they stand together - force them to take on the world on their own every now and then.</p><ul><li><strong>Put someone on the spot.</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, a character ends up in so much trouble, they can't get out alone. While the Elf is busy holding off a mighty foe, a second sneaks up behind them. While the Heir is still reeling from that blow to the head, trying to defend themselves from the enemy's furious onslaught, they don't notice they're backing straight towards a cliff. And that's when you change the Spotlight. Put a player in hot water, and then turn to someone else and ask them, what do you do?</p><p>This Cut is extremely important, and should be a staple fallback for any Overlord. The key phrase for using this Cut is \"While you're doing that...\" The players will be proactive, they will jump into situations they shouldn't, they will be in danger. And you can always use this Cut to give someone else a chance to have their back, a shot at real teamwork and companionship, and a sense that this journey needs every single one of them to succeed.</p><ul><li><strong>Present an opportunity.</strong></li></ul><p>You don't always need to be mean. When the players follow a plan, succeed at something, or just need a break, show them an opportunity. Give them an opening, have them spot something crucial, have an enemy make a mistake or trip up. If someone's been having a rough night, use this Cut to throw them a bone. If someone asks if there's something they could swing off of, tell them about the chandelier or conveniently placed vine. If you ever think of something really cool they could be doing right now, that's when you present an opportunity.</p><ul><li><strong>Show a downside.</strong></li></ul><p>Nothing is perfect. Sometimes your tiny dwarf arms just aren't long enough to reach your friend dangling off the edge of the cliff. Sometimes your spear is just too long to deal with an enemy who gets right up in your face. Sometimes your horse panics and runs off in completely random directions you really didn't want to go in. And it is your job to make sure the players know these sorts of things, especially when it's a really bad time for them to know these sorts of things.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell them the consequences or requirements.</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes a player will ask you for something completely wild, or they'll ask for something reasonable during a really dangerous situation, or they'll want to do something they just can't without getting something else first. At times like this, you can always let them know what it'll cost them. Sure, you can sprint for the exit, but the ogre will take a swing at you if you do. Of course you can buy that, if you have 50 coins. Yeah, you can climb that castle wall, but you'll need some climbing gear, it's too smooth to go bare-handed. And you'll need to be careful, the castle almost certainly has a guard posted up on top of that wall.</p><p>This Cut has a lot of synergy with the Principle, \"Don't shut them down.\" You cannot say no. Never say no. But you can say something like \"You can only do that by getting the help of the Elven Queen herself.\" If they want to do the impossible, you need to let them know just how much the impossible costs.</p><h2>Threats: Challenging the Fellowship</h2><p>Now that you know how to generally run the game and have a basic idea of how to play as the Overlord themselves, the next thing you need to know is the various kinds of challenges that you can throw at the fellowship. You have a large variety of tools at your fingertips, which you can find in Chapter 7. This section will tell you how to use those tools.</p><p>Enemies and obstacles in <em>Fellowship</em> work similarly to the fellowship's Companions, but they will act a bit more freely. They have several stats, and each of their stats gives them access to a Threat. So long as they have that stat, they pose the listed Threat to the fellowship.</p><p>Unlike Companions, which damage themselves when they do something to prevent them from doing everything, the only thing stopping a threat from continuing to be a problem is the fellowship. <strong>When an enemy's stat becomes damaged,</strong> they lose the threat attached to it.</p><p>The simple way to think of this is, when the fellowship deals damage to something, they are actually taking away its abilities to stop them. \"Damage\" in <em>Fellowship</em> is not necessarily violence and bloodshed, but rather, it is the strength, skill, tact, or plan that you use to neutralize a problem. This is why the 10+ result to <em>Finish Them</em> lets you \"destroy them, with whatever that means.\" These are not necessarily by lethal means, as there are many many ways to keep someone from wanting to hurt you or stop you anymore.</p><p>Often, they will not need to go all the way through and damage everything a threat can do to get past it. It is in the fellowship's best interests to neutralize their enemies quickly and efficiently and get past them, because they don't have the time or the resources to waste on every single thing that gets in their way.</p><p>For example, let's say the fellowship must fight a wild Varg that got onto the path. A Varg looks like this:</p><p><strong>Varg:</strong> <em>These massive wolves are large enough for a full grown ogre to ride, and surly enough to make an ogre think twice about doing it.</em></p><p><strong>Cruel Beast:</strong> A Varg is wild and malicious, and cannot be tamed easily. Anyone trying to ride it must Pay a Price.</p><p><strong>Go For The Jugular:</strong> A Varg that gets up on top of somebody instantly deals damage to them.</p><p>These stats include their Name and a Description first. The Description will always be in <em>italics</em>, and has no rules associated with it. Below that, in Bold, are the Varg's stats: Cruel Beast and Go For The Jugular. They will keep those stats whether they are a Companion or an enemy. The descriptions after the stats are the Varg's Threats. These Threats only apply while this enemy is under the Overlord's control, and are additional moves or abilities the enemy will use to threaten, hinder, or harm the fellowship, or to protect themselves.</p><p>In addition to the threats listed on the Varg's stat block, it always has all of your Cuts as well. You can use the Varg to <em>Separate Them or Put Someone On The Spot</em> or any of the other Cuts you'd like to use. Even if they damage its ability to <strong>Go For The Jugular</strong>, if it is a particularly tenacious Varg or the fellowship continues to fight it, it can keep using your Cuts until they defeat it, escape from it, or befriend it.</p><p>An enemy that has had all of its stats damaged is destroyed. The fellowship doesn't need to get a 10+ on <em>Finish Them</em> for every enemy they come across to defeat it entirely. An enemy that has been destroyed cannot use your Cuts, and is no longer willing or able to stop the fellowship.</p><p>If you were attentive, you may have noticed that the Varg's stats are the same as the ones listed in the Orc's Companions option in Chapter 3. That is because:</p><p><strong>Every enemy is able to be recruited by the fellowship if they sit down and </strong><em><strong>Forge a Bond</strong></em><strong> with it.</strong></p><p>When an enemy becomes a Companion, they lose the threats attached to their stats, and keep just the stats. When working with the fellowship, they follow the Companion rules instead of the enemy rules.</p><p>Non-violence is assumed within several core rules of the game. The fellowship only has one Move for actually harming and destroying enemies. Everything else is for dealing with them in other ways.</p><p>When something is in their way, they can always <em>Get Away</em> from it. When someone is preventing them from doing something important, one of the fellowship can always try to <em>Keep Them Busy</em>. You always have the option to try to <em>Talk Sense</em> instead of violence.</p><p>The fellowship is perfectly capable of fighting when they must, but it is important to encourage them to try other options as well. Not everything must be to the death.</p><p>There is one type of enemy that cannot be recruited and cannot be reasoned with: Barriers. A barrier is a threat that is simply in the way, and they are usually forces of nature, obstacles in the path, or magical interference. They are otherwise interacted with and engaged in the exact same ways that any other enemy would be.</p><h2>The Rule of Three</h2><p>Sometimes you need many of the same threat in a single scene. Wolves don't hunt alone, bandits ambush in groups, and the overlord has their armies. <strong>When you need many of the same Threat at once,</strong> that's when the Rule of Three applies.</p><p>The <strong>Rule of Three</strong> states that three or more enemies working together form a Group, thirty or more enemies form a <strong>Gang</strong>, and three hundred or more enemies form an <strong>Army</strong>. They gain a Stat with the same name and a few unique rules, but otherwise function like normal. <strong>These stats are:</strong></p><p><strong>Group:</strong> This enemy can act against two people at once. <strong>When this enemy is destroyed,</strong> this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left, replace the Group with two normal enemies.</p><p><strong>Gang:</strong> This enemy can act against everyone at once. <strong>When this enemy is destroyed,</strong> this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left, replace the Gang with two Groups of this enemy. This stat can only be damaged by Dangerous or Area attacks.</p><p><strong>Army:</strong> This enemy can act against an entire location at once, and its attacks have the Area tag. <strong>When this enemy is destroyed, this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left,</strong> replace the Army with two Gangs of this enemy. This enemy can only be damaged by Dangerous or Area attacks.</p><p>Mechanically, this makes groups much harder to hold off or fight against, because you cannot <em>Keep Them Busy</em> easily. A Group needs two players working together to properly <em>Keep Them Busy</em>, since they can act against two players at once, and a Gang or larger cannot be Kept Busy without some serious working for it. You would need a bottleneck to fight them in, or a Move that allows you to do so, or some extreme support, like an army of your own, a giant robot, a dragon, or something similar.</p><p>So when you have three or more Wolves working together, they form a Group of Wolves, which looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wolf Pack:</strong> <em>A group of pack hunters, on the prowl.</em></p><p><strong>Pack Hunter:</strong> A wolf is never alone, and they gang up on their prey one at a time. When someone tries to fight the wolves alone, they are always <em>put on the spot</em>.</p><p><strong>Loyal:</strong> Wolves stick together and look out for each other. <strong>When this stat is damaged,</strong> they will co-ordinate to let their wounded flee safely before backing off.</p><p><strong>Group:</strong> This enemy can make moves against two players at once. <strong>When this enemy is destroyed, this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left,</strong> replace the Group with two normal Wolves.</p><p>When the Wolf Pack attacks the fellowship, they can attack two players at once. When someone is <em>Keeping Them Busy</em>, they can still attack or make Cuts against one other player. If their Loyal stat is damaged, the Wolves will retreat to live to fight another day, as normal - being a Group doesn't change the mechanics of any of their normal Threats.</p><p>In this way, the pack of wolves works the same as they would individually - groups continue to function as they normally would and generally follow the same flow of play, just harder to deal with due to their numbers.</p><p>The <strong>Rule of Three</strong> generally only applies when combining the same threat together. 15 Skeletons and 15 Zombies will make a Group of Skeletons and a Group of Zombies, for example. However, if you want to make two enemies into a bigger, more cohesive threat and represent them working together closely, you could have the above groups become a Gang of Skeletons and Zombies. In that case, you would combine all of their stats and threats together. When the Gang is defeated, they would then break up into a Group of Skeletons and a Group of Zombies. In this way, the Rule of Three can be used to let a group of enemies work closely as a team, even if they aren't all the same enemy. The Gang of Skeletons and Zombies would look like this:</p><p><strong>Gang of Skeletons and Zombies:</strong> Mindless undead, working towards a common purpose.</p><p><strong>Just Bones:</strong> Skeletons do not take damage from anything that would slip right through them or is made to harm flesh. Most piercing weapons, ranged weapons, slashing weapons, and poison or fire-based attacks will have very little effect on a Skeleton.</p><p><strong>Weapons Training:</strong> Skeletons almost always carry a weapon of some kind. A skeleton has a single tag from this list: Armor (1 Use), Piercing, or Ranged.</p><p><strong>Painless:</strong> Zombies do not stop attacking until they are destroyed. If they take damage while all of their stats are already damaged, they are destroyed.</p><p><strong>Simpleton Hivemind:</strong> A group of zombies acts as a single unit, moving as one towards the nearest source of living meat. They are easily duped and confused - <strong>when this stat is damaged,</strong> the gang loses focus, stops hunting, and will only attack if you get within arm's reach.</p><p><strong>Gang:</strong> A gang can make moves against everyone at once. <strong>When this enemy is destroyed, this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left,</strong> replace this enemy with a Group of Skeletons and a Group of Zombies. This stat can only be damaged by Dangerous or Area attacks.</p><h2>Set Pieces</h2><p>You can mix and match enemies and barriers to create interesting encounters and fun obstacles for the fellowship to encounter, but sometimes you want something more. Sometimes you want to go a step beyond. When that time comes, you will need a Set Piece.</p><p>A Set Piece is a collection of threats that cannot stand on their own, and work together as a cohesive whole. Set Pieces are for things like multi-stage boss fights, a long and connected encounter, chase scenes, obstacle courses, sports tournaments, and all sorts of other large-scale events. A Set Piece can carry an entire session by itself! They are no joke.</p><p>Set Pieces cannot be destroyed. On a 10+ result from <em>Finish Them</em>, or when any other move would say to destroy them, they take damage instead.</p><p>For an example of a Set Piece, here is the Stone Colossus:</p><h3>Set Pieces: The Stone Colossus</h3><p><strong>Army of One:</strong> A giant statue of stone, brought to life and used as a machine of war. Its defenses are many, and its weapons carry several tons of stone behind each blow. <strong>If either of these stats are damaged, the Colossus is destroyed</strong>.</p><p><strong>Massive Stone Body:</strong> The Colossus's massive body is built to last. This stat cannot be damaged by anything less than siege weaponry and high explosives. <strong>If this stat is damaged,</strong> the Colossus falls over, and everyone near it risks being crushed.</p><p><strong>Power Core:</strong> The Colossus has a weak point deep inside of it - a mechanical or magical core that powers it. Anyone near the core risks being set on fire by its intense heat. <strong>If this stat is damaged,</strong> the Colossus falls apart, and everyone inside it risks being crushed.</p><p><strong>Armored Exterior:</strong> The Colossus is nearly invincible. If you don't deal with its thick outer shell of stone, you cannot hope to stop it for good.</p><p><strong>Six Feet of Stone:</strong> The Colossus' armor is several feet thick, and cannot be damaged by anything less than siege weaponry and high explosives. <strong>Unless this stat is damaged,</strong> you cannot harm the Colossus' Massive Stone Body.</p><p><strong>Maintenance Tunnel:</strong> There is a secret entrance into the Colossus, but it is well hidden, hard to reach, and locked. <strong>Unless this stat is damaged,</strong> you cannot get reach the Colossus' Power Core.</p><p><strong>Hands of God:</strong> The Colossus' massive arms and legs are its main threat. They can crush you like a fly, and stopping them requires some serious firepower of your own.</p><p><strong>This Right Hand Of Mine:</strong> The right arm of the Colossus holds a massive sword, which can be used to destroy anything it can hit. It swings slowly, but the blow covers such a large area it can be difficult to dodge. <strong>Anyone directly hit by this weapon is Taken Out, damaging all of their stats</strong>.</p><p><strong>The Left Arm:</strong> The left arm of the Colossus is free, but it can use it to swat off anyone trying to harm it. Climbing the Colossus is dangerous while this arm is functional.</p><p><strong>Pillars of Stone:</strong> The legs of the Colossus can crush anything underfoot. The Colossus can simply walk through anything in its path, destroying all vehicles and structures that get in the way, and it leaves massive footprints wherever it goes. <strong>If this stat is damaged,</strong> the Colossus becomes immobile, and crashes to the ground, potentially crushing anyone below it.</p><p>The Colossus is three threats in one! The primary threat, the Colossus itself, is the only one that strictly must be overcome to defeat it, but while its armor and its massive stone arms exist, it is significantly more threatening. The players must contend with the Colossus' attacks and overcome its defenses in order to get at it properly. It is difficult to fight and will likely take several scenes or an entire Showdown to deal with it, and running may be your best option during a first encounter, but that's what a proper Set Piece is all about.</p><p>A Set Piece is an entire encounter all laid out like this, with every piece actively working with or protecting the other elements of the Set Piece, or laid out in stages where each piece of the Set Piece must be overcome one at a time before the fellowship can move on to the next part of the encounter. Set Pieces are excellent for boss battles, extended trials, and journeys through a dangerous place. <strong>When using a Set Piece,</strong> it always uses the Challenge story structure, even if you use it to spice up a long journey.</p><p>See Chapter 7 for several already crafted Set Pieces.</p><h3>Generals</h3><p>The Overlord's Generals are special threats, a little different from the norm. <strong>To create a General,</strong> pick any single threat from Chapter 7, and make it a <strong>Threat to the World</strong>. They have access to all of your Overlord Basic Moves, but not your Overlord Core or Custom moves.</p><p>You do not need to change any of the General's other stats, although you can if you want to add some originality to them. They do not get any extra threats over the basic version of themselves. Having access to your Overlord Basic Moves gives them plenty of power, allowing them to act in your place in most regards.</p><p><strong>When a General uses an Overlord Move that references Bonds (</strong><em><strong>Heart of Iron</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>Twist the Knife</strong></em><strong>)</strong>, they use your Overlord's Bonds for determining if they trigger the Move or not. They can erase your Bonds to use Heart of Iron.</p><p>Your Generals can also have whatever minions they need to be effective. This doesn't mean you should give all of your Generals an entire Army, unless it happens to be your actual, main Army that they are leading. Your Generals only take whatever forces they need or you deploy them with.</p><p>A good place for your Generals to be is wherever your current Master Plan says your forces are. As the plan proceeds, give them more dangerous forces. If the fellowship attacks a General scoping out a location for one of your New Plans, they should have only their personal retinue with them, or maybe just a scouting patrol - the General might not even be there yet.</p><p>If the fellowship doesn't get there until the General is already Executing The Plan, then maybe they'll find a full-on army waging war, or an elite infiltration force just waiting for the word to strike, with the General at the head of those forces. The closer a plan is to completion, the scarier the forces working on the plan will be.</p><p>If a General is kicking their butts, you can always remind them that retreating and regrouping is an option. Generals are a serious <strong>Threat to the World</strong>, and everything is on the table when you're fighting one of those. They may not be quite so dangerous as the Overlord is, but they are no slouches either. They're the Overlord's best, and they should give the fellowship a hard time.</p><h3>A Source of Power</h3><p>\"Source of Power\" is a phrase tossed around a lot throughout Fellowship, but what is a source of power, exactly? A Source of Power is something in this fantasy world that is extremely valuable, powerful, or important, for any reason. The One Ring is Sauron's Source of Power, but a Source of Power doesn't need to be something the Overlord already has. For example, the Life Tree that all elves draw power from could be a Source of Power, one with drastic consequences if the Overlord takes it.</p><p>Sources of Power are usually either hidden away in a secret place, kept safe by a protector, or are the pride of their kingdom. There is no such thing as a Source of Power that isn't surrounded by myths and legends stretching back ages, and at least one player should be able to <em>Command Lore</em> about any given Source of Power you come across. They are not something that should ever fall out of whatever place they are kept, and the Overlord is actively seeking them to take for her own power.</p><p>Some example Sources of Power:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Colossus</strong>, a massive stone creature whose fiery heart could power all sorts of incredible machinery or eldritch rituals.</li><li>The <strong>Emerald Skull</strong>, an artifact of supreme necromantic power. No one knows what exactly it does, but none who hold it ever hold it for long.</li><li>The <strong>First Bird To Fly</strong>. So successful was this creature that it now lives among the stars, as a constellation. Any who can reach it gain unparalleled control over the skies themselves.</li><li>The <strong>Wishmaker</strong>, a stone obelisk that will grant your fondest desire, but only once, and perhaps not as you'd like.</li><li>The <strong>Ruby Eye</strong>, an ornate pendant that can see through time. Peering into its depths has driven many an oracle mad.</li><li>The <strong>Eternal Torch</strong>, the source of all fire. Lesser fires are drawn to it, consumed by it, and its heat has no equal.</li></ul>"

        "content": "<h2>Using Your Arsenal</h2><p>When using a threat, make sure everyone knows their Stats. They don't need to know what the threats do specifically, but that information isn't hidden either - if someone asks what the Burning Building's <strong>Fire Everywhere</strong> stat does, let them know. The threats will usually follow from the stats, but maximum clarity is allowed and preferred. The tension (usually) comes from how they deal with an enemy, not in figuring out how the enemy works.</p><p><strong>If a player wants more information than the stat block provides,</strong> they'll need to <em>Look Closely</em> at them or <em>Speak Softly</em> with them. If an enemy is hidden or has a stat about being stealthy or mysterious, you can make an exception, and not tell them anything until the mystery is solved or the enemy reveals themselves.</p><p>However, some enemies are sneakier than others, and their moves are <strong>Secret</strong>. <strong>Secret Threats</strong> do not reveal their stats or what they do until it becomes relevant. Usually, only Traps will be <strong>Secret</strong>, but some wily or particularly dangerous enemies can also have Secrets. Secrets can be revealed through player action, such as <em>Looking Closely</em> or when it would make sense to be revealed, but otherwise, their moves are known only to the Overlord.</p><p>Set Pieces are always <strong>Secret</strong>, but only the parts they haven't seen yet. As soon as part of a Set Piece becomes relevant, reveal the entirety of that part to the players. Some Set Pieces have you choose from several options - only reveal the options the players are actually facing, and only when they come across them. If the players find that the secret of the Haunted Forest is the ravenous beasts that hunt among the woods, they don't need to know the other potential secrets - you can surprise them with those later on, in a different haunted forest, perhaps.</p><p>Several threats are underneath a type of army the Overlord holds. The Overlord can only make use of the threats underneath their Army for advancing their personal goals. Those threats tell your players that the Overlord is directly involved.</p><p>However, the Overlord player can use any threat in this chapter to challenge the fellowship - threats outside the Overlord's army are not under the Overlord's control, but there's plenty of reason a Fire Giant or a Gang of Zombies might confront the fellowship even without an Overlord telling them to. This entire chapter is your Arsenal, even if only some of it bears your signature and acts to your will.</p><h2>Barriers</h2><p>Barriers are those threats that get in your way and are not alive things. They are common at all points of the story, but especially during a Journey. Some Overlords love to use Barriers, especially traps, while other Overlords find them pointless and a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Arrow Trap:</strong> Thwip! You've been shot! This trap isn't necessarily mechanical an archer or gunner in hiding can also be an <strong>Arrow Trap</strong>.</p><p>This threat is <strong>Secret</strong>.<br /><strong>Hidden Trap:</strong> When a player in range of the trap makes a Move, the Overlord can reveal this trap to make them pay a price. This trap will continue to threaten its area until this stat is damaged. The trap is no longer <strong>Secret</strong>.</p><h3>Broken Bridge: The bridge is out.</h3><p><strong>Shoddy Construction:</strong> The bridge cannot be crossed unless it is repaired.<br /><strong>Long Way Around:</strong> There's another way across, but it isn't close.</p><p><strong>Burning Building:</strong> Everything is on fire and it's all falling apart.<br /><strong>Fire Everywhere:</strong> Nowhere is safe in here. Everyone who makes a Move inside the burning building must <strong>Pay A Price</strong>, or else they roll with <strong>Despair</strong>. Anyone immune to fire is immune to this effect.</p><p><strong>Falling Apart:</strong> Whenever anyone does anything reckless or fails a Move while inside the burning building, a route becomes closed off by the building falling apart. A hole opens up in the floor, or a wall collapses in front of you, that kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Falling Block Trap:</strong> The ceiling has suddenly collapsed!</p><p>This threat is <strong>Secret</strong>.<br /><strong>Hidden Trap:</strong> When a player has to pay a price, the Overlord can instead damage this stat to have it drop on them. The trap is no longer <strong>Secret</strong>.</p><p><strong>Pile of Rubble:</strong> This trap leaves a pile of rubble behind, blocking off a passageway. The person who triggered the trap, along with everyone right next to them, immediately takes 2 damage and are buried, unless they <em>Overcome</em> or <em>Get Away</em> from the falling rubble. Anyone buried is unable to move without outside help, unless they are very tough.</p><p>The passage remains blocked until this stat is damaged.</p><p><strong>Magic Barrier:</strong> You can't get through here. There's some kind of glowing blue wall in your way.</p><p><strong>Impenetrable:</strong> The <strong>Magic Barrier</strong> cannot take damage.<br /><strong>Some Shall Pass:</strong> Barriers are designed to keep out all but a few. This barrier will allow people with a certain characteristic to pass, such as those carrying the right rune, or those who speak the password, or those who are <strong>Elves</strong> or <strong>Elf-Friends</strong>, or it won't let <strong>Dwarves</strong> pass. Every barrier has different criteria for entry, and figuring it out may let you through.</p><p><strong>Pit Trap:</strong> The ground is suddenly not ground, and that sucks.</p><p>This threat is <strong>Secret</strong>.<br /><strong>Hidden Trap:</strong> When a player has to pay a price, the Overlord can instead damage this stat to put them into the pit. The trap is no longer <strong>Secret</strong>.</p><p><strong>Long Way Down:</strong> Falling in or being knocked into the pit deals 1 damage to anyone who can't slow their fall somehow.</p><p><strong>Poison Trap:</strong> Poison is extremely dangerous and will hinder even the mightiest warriors. When adding poison to a threat, choose only one type of <strong>Poison</strong> from the lists below. Don't use all of them, that's rude.</p><p>This threat is <strong>Secret</strong>.<br /><strong>Hidden Trap:</strong> When a player takes damage from a trap or dangerous enemy, the Overlord can damage this stat to poison them. Anyone else damaged by the same source becomes poisoned with the same poison.</p><p><strong>Curse-Touch:</strong> This dark poison leaves a burning wound that does not heal. The damage they took is Necrotic.</p><p><strong>Elfsbane:</strong> This crippling poison slows their movements considerably. The victim gains the Slow tag. When they heal, they may remove the Slow tag instead of healing any damage.</p><p><strong>Ogretooth Rot:</strong> This nauseating poison makes them ill and weak, for a time. They become <em>Drunk</em>.</p><p><strong>Snake Venom:</strong> The only way to fight this deadly poison is to devote everything you have to it. For the rest of this scene, the victim must damage one of their stats every time they roll the dice.</p><p><strong>Spiderfang:</strong> This localized venom numbs and paralyzes around the point of entry. An affected arm falls limp and useless, a leg cannot support you, a hand cannot hold anything, and if it hits your head, you fall unconscious.</p><p><strong>Spike Trap:</strong> Spikes poke out from the walls, floors, ceiling... It's bad.<br />This threat is <strong>Secret</strong>.<br /><strong>Hidden Trap:</strong> When a player has to pay a price, the Overlord can instead damage this stat to deal 1 damage to them. The trap is no longer <strong>Secret</strong>.</p><p><strong>Danger Zone:</strong> The spikes have very specific places they threaten, and they will stab anyone entering their danger zone. Anyone entering a danger zone immediately takes 1 damage. This is a <strong>Hard Cut</strong> and cannot be reacted to - the damage is instant.</p><p><strong>Taboo:</strong> \"Do no harm,\" the sigil says. Heed this warning.</p><p><strong>Do No Harm:</strong> This place is under a spell of protection. The trigger will be labeled all throughout the area - \"Do No Harm\" and \"Do Not Enter\" are popular ones, but the command can be anything. Anyone who breaks the taboo will be punished immediately.</p><p>The punishment can come in many forms, but once it is revealed, it must be consistent. If breaking the taboo summons a golem, it will always summon a golem, no matter who breaks it. Common punishments are immediate damage, immediate banishment (either from the zone or into a holding area elsewhere), or summoning monsters to attack the transgressor. <strong>Golems</strong>, <strong>undead</strong>, and <strong>demons</strong> are the most common defenders of a taboo.</p><p>The <strong>Taboo</strong> will always have a source somewhere around the center of its area. A spell scroll or magic crystal is common. If this source is destroyed or taken away from its place, damage this stat, and the taboo ends.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Creacherous CDountains</h3><p><strong>The Mountain Ridge:</strong> Only two ways to get through a wall of mountains in your way: The dangerous pass, or the tunnels below.</p><p><strong>Finding the Mountain Pass:</strong> The pass is out of the way and difficult to reach, but it's the only way to get vehicles and most mounts over the mountain. When you damage this stat, you find the mountain pass. If you have a map of the mountains, you can damage this stat for free.</p><p><strong>The Hidden Tunnels:</strong> Every major mountain has tunnels below it, built by nature, the old ones past, or more recently, the dwarves. When you damage this stat, you find the hidden tunnel entrance. If you are <strong>The Dwarf</strong>, you can damage this stat for free.</p><p><strong>The Mountain Pass:</strong> There are many perils on the mountain pass, and each must be overcome to get through. When all three of these stats are damaged, you make it through the pass.</p><p><strong>The Narrow Pass:</strong> The pass is loaded with narrow ledges and broken parts of the path that are difficult to navigate. If each player can successfully <em>Overcome</em> or <em>Get Away</em> from the <strong>Narrow Roads</strong>, damage this stat. When you damage this stat, the rest of the road is clear.</p><p><strong>The Creatures Above:</strong> Beasts prowl these paths, and there is no way through without encountering them. At any time, the Overlord may damage this stat to have a Group or <strong>Gang of Beasts</strong> appear, hungry and violent.</p><p><strong>The Long Road:</strong> The fellowship must stop and rest several times during this trek. When they have <strong>Filled Their Belly</strong> for the third time while on the mountain pass, damage this stat.</p><p><strong>The Tunnels Below:</strong> The mines and tunnels beneath the mountain are never as quiet and empty as everyone wants them to be. When all three of these stats are damaged, you make it through the tunnels.</p><p><strong>The Difficult Tunnels:</strong> You cannot bring vehicles or large equipment through the tunnels below. At least, not easily. When they Use or discard all such equipment, damage this stat. If they have a <strong>Dwarven Tunneler</strong> or other means of getting your equipment through, damage this stat.</p><p><strong>The Hard Part:</strong> At some point, there will be a nearly impassible obstacle you cannot go around, such as a large lake, a deep chasm, or a river of lava. When you find your way past it, damage this stat.</p><p><strong>The Demons Below:</strong> A dangerous creature lives down here. At some point, it will find you. At any time, the Overlord may damage this stat to have a <strong>Titan</strong> appear.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Daunted Forest</h3><p>Backer <strong>Set Piece</strong></p><p><strong>The Lost Roads:</strong> The<strong>Haunted Forest</strong> is not to be trifled with. Follow the road closely, or you will never find your way back out.</p><p><strong>Losing Your Way:</strong> Anyone who leaves the road immediately loses the road. Anyone who strays more than a few feet away from anyone else loses track of them. The Elf or a <strong>Guide</strong> can always find someone who has lost their way, but it takes time, and they can only find one at a time.</p><p><strong>Finding Your Way:</strong> When you are lost and have the <strong>Spotlight</strong>, you may damage yourCourage, Sense, or Wisdom to find someone else, or find the road.</p><p><strong>The Haunting Sounds:</strong> The woods themselves intend to lure you off the path. Try not to listen too closely. When every distraction has been passed by, the<strong>Lurking Shadows</strong> will approach.</p><p><strong>A Cry For Help:</strong> You hear someone's voice, calling out for help, just off the path. If anyone is already lost, it sounds like their voice. Anyone following the voice will become lost immediately. If no one falls for it, the most heroic character must roll to <em>Overcome</em> following this voice.</p><p><strong>A Light in the Distance:</strong> A comforting light is visible on a hill, off to the left - a campfire, or maybe the light of a lodge. It looks like there's a small path in the overgrowth leading that way. Anyone following the light will find they can never get closer to it, and they will become lost. If no one falls for it, the character who most wants relief must roll to <em>Overcome</em> following the light.</p><p><strong>A Soft Gentle Song:</strong> A haunting voice sings in the distance, sad and beautiful. Anyone following the voice, obviously, gets lost instantly. If no one falls for it, the player most likely to give up on this quest must roll to <em>Overcome</em> following the song.</p><p><strong>The Lurking Shadows:</strong> The forest leads people off the path for a reason, and you're about to find out why. Choose one of these:</p><p><strong>The Lost Children:</strong> The heroes who are still <strong>Lost</strong> each set a scene with the ghost of someone else who was lost. They tell you their story, and lead you back to the path... For a price. Tell us what it costs you to find your way out.</p><p><strong>Hidden Kindness:</strong> The creature of the forest is lonely, and simply wants companionship. Ramp up the paranoia of whoever is left on the road, make things darker and scarier, and if you must, force them off the path in order to reveal everyone else had been drinking and eating and sharing stories with the creature in her cabin. After a fine meal, you are sent on your way.</p><p><strong>The Darkness Hungers:</strong> Dangerous beasts prey on those who get lost. Everyone makes it back to the road simultaneously, just as dozens, if not hundreds, of wild beasts converge upon your location. Run - they will not follow you out of the forest.</p><h2>Beasts</h2><p>Beasts are those threats that aren't a part of the Overlord's business, but will probably try to kill you if you give them good reason to, or if they are hungry enough. They are commonly met during both the <strong>Journey</strong> and during a <strong>Challenge</strong>, but rarely met outside of those two stories.</p><p><strong>Donkey:</strong> Donkeys are similar to horses, but a little smaller, a little tougher, and infinitely more stubborn.</p><p><strong>Beast of Burden:</strong> The donkey can carry much more than you'd think it could, but it does not like you, and it won't move while over-burdened.</p><p><strong>Horse:</strong> A horse, of course.</p><p><strong>Run Like The Wind:</strong> Horses are famous for their speed. You cannot catch a horse that is running from you.</p><p><strong>Giant Spider:</strong> Many find these massive spiders absolutely terrifying, but halflings find their mobility to be second to none.</p><p><strong>Wall Crawler:</strong> Giant spiders can walk across any solid surface with ease, no matter the surface's orientation. They can also spin webs to cross gaps or create bridges or build homes.</p><p><strong>Creepy:</strong> Giant spiders are terrifying. If yourCourage is damaged, you cannot stand up to a <strong>Giant Spider</strong>.</p><p><strong>Hunting Bird:</strong> Birds of a feather hunt together.</p><p><strong>Go For The Eyes:</strong> Hunting birds can only harm the stat Sense. If they would deal damage to someone whose Sense is damaged, the hunting bird <strong>Keeps Them Busy</strong> instead.</p><p><strong>Eagle Eye:</strong> Hunting birds can see you coming a mile away, and will never attack the whole group at once. They go after stragglers, or those cut off from the group.</p><p><strong>Owl Bear:</strong> An Owl Bear is only as scary as a bear is, but for some reason being part owl makes them angrier and viciously bloodthirsty.</p><p><strong>Blood Hunter:</strong> The scent of blood drives owl bears into a frenzy, and they are ferocious combatants against the injured. If your Blood is damaged, an <strong>Owl Bear's Cuts</strong> against you are <strong>Hard Cuts</strong>.</p><p><strong>Claws and Death:</strong> When an owl bear causes damage, it deals a second point of damage. This extra damage can be dealt to either the same target or a different enemy near them.</p><p><strong>Pegasus:</strong> A winged horse. Like a regular horse, but significantly more mobile.</p><p><strong>Flight:</strong> A pegasus can fly, and will never stick around for a fight unless it has a rider.</p><p><strong>Mounted Combat:</strong> Pegasi are famously good mounts, and work perfectly with a rider. They are well trained and easily maneuvered.</p><p><strong>Unicorn:</strong> A beautiful horned horse, famous for their benevolence.<br /><strong>Infinite Compassion:</strong> A <strong>Unicorn</strong> will never start a fight. When you attack a <strong>Unicorn</strong>, whether or not you succeed, damage this stat.</p><p><strong>Holy Horn:</strong> A <strong>Unicorn's</strong> horn is famous for its healing properties. If you pay it with something Precious, it will heal you and your companions for one damage each.</p><p><strong>Varg:</strong> These massive wolves are large enough for a full grown ogre to ride, and surly enough to make an ogre think twice about doing it.</p><p><strong>Cruel Beast:</strong> A <strong>Varg</strong> is wild and malicious, and cannot be tamed easily. Anyone trying to ride it must <strong>Pay a Price</strong>.</p><p><strong>Go For The Jugular:</strong> A <strong>Varg</strong> that gets up on top of somebody instantly deals damage to them.</p><p><strong>War Elephant:</strong> The largest in ground-based war animal technology, these massive creatures can support a small building on their backs. The APC of the fantasy age.</p><p><strong>Armored Riding Platform:</strong> Anyone on top of the elephant cannot be harmed, except by other people on top of the elephant.</p><p><strong>Tusks and Screaming:</strong> A <strong>War Elephant</strong> is <em>Dangerous</em> and can trample or gouge anything in its path. Anyone in its way when it charges takes damage.</p><p><strong>War Horse:</strong> A horse trained for war.</p><p><strong>Run Like The Wind:</strong> Horses are famous for their speed. You cannot catch a horse that is running from you.</p><p><strong>Mounted Combat:</strong> Horses are famously good mounts, and work perfectly with a rider. They are well trained and easily maneuvered.</p><p><strong>Wild Boar:</strong> These wild beasts are popular among both halfling war riders and halfling chefs.</p><p><strong>Pig-Headed:</strong> Boars are ferocious and territorial beasts. When you gain a <strong>Boar's</strong> ire, it will chase you until this stat is damaged. They will follow you into a new scene if ignored.</p><p><strong>Wild Charge:</strong> When a wild boar charges, it keeps going until it hits something. The first thing in their way that has a damaged Sense stat or is distracted takes 1 damage and is knocked aside by its wild charge. Anyone who is not distracted and has undamaged <strong>Senses</strong> can easily avoid the charge. If the boar hits nobody, it damages this stat instead.</p><p><strong>Wolf:</strong> Wolves are too wild for humans to handle, but they make fine pets for elves and orcs alike. Wild wolves are almost always encountered in a Group, but the largest packs may be a <strong>Gang</strong>.</p><p><strong>Pack Hunter:</strong> A wolf never fights alone if they can help it, and they gang up on their prey one at a time. When someone fights the wolves alone, they are always put on the spot. If this wolf isn't part of a Group or <strong>Gang</strong>, damage this stat.</p><p><strong>Loyal:</strong> Wolves stick together and look out for each other. When this stat is damaged, they will co-ordinate to let their wounded flee safely before backing off.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Old Dragon</h3><p>The <strong>Dragon's Lair:</strong> If you sneak into the dragon's lair, you must go through this section before fighting it. If you make it through, you get to ambush the <strong>Wild Dragon</strong> in its treasure room.</p><p>The <strong>Lair's Defenses:</strong> Go through the <strong>Dragon's Lair</strong> as a <strong>Long Journey</strong>, where each player sets an obstacle in their path. Each obstacle will require at least one roll to get past.</p><p>The <strong>Need For Secrecy:</strong> The first time someone rolls a 6-, the dragon stirs, but does not awaken. The second time someone rolls a 6-, the dragon awakens, now alert and concerned. It will be awake when you reach the <strong>Dragon's Treasure</strong>. At this point, if someone rolls a 9-, the dragon becomes aware of your presence, and you move on to the <strong>Dragon's Treasure</strong> with the dragon ready and waiting for you.</p><p>The <strong>Dragon's Treasure:</strong> The dragon's treasure vault is where it spends most of its time, fast asleep. If you're lucky, you can get the drop on it. If you can defeat it here, it will never make it to the open skies.</p><p><strong>Deadly Beast:</strong> The dragon is a weapon with <em>Melee</em>, <strong>Area</strong>, Piercing, and Armor (3 Uses). Killing it is no easy task, and it is violent and deadly.</p><p><strong>Dragonfire:</strong> Anyone hit by the dragon's deadly fire is immediately <em>Taken Out</em> if they are not immune to fire. If they are immune to fire, they take 2 damage instead. The dragon always inhales sharply before shooting fire, giving everyone in the way a chance to <em>Get Away</em> from or <em>Overcome</em> the attack.</p><p><strong>Treasure Fixation:</strong> The dragon has a themed treasure horde of valuable things it enjoys. Anyone bringing gifts of Precious things or items that fit with the dragon's treasure theme will always be given a chance to talk to the dragon peacefully, although it may not last.</p><p><strong>Escape Route:</strong> If the dragon's Armor hits 0 Uses or it feels threatened, it will attempt to flee to the open sky. Unless its escape route is cut off by damaging this stat, it will escape to the <strong>Dragon's Flight</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>Dragon's Flight:</strong> The dragon has taken to the skies. If you don't defeat it here and now, it will destroy an entire community in its rage.</p><p><strong>Deadly Beast:</strong> As above, retaining as much armor as it had before.<br /><strong>Dragonfire:</strong> As above. If that stat was damaged, it remains damaged in this phase of the fight.</p><p><strong>Flight:</strong> The dragon cannot be hit by <em>Melee</em> attacks except from people climbing it. It will regularly dive bomb at the players if they keep its attention, dealing damage to everyone it passes by, but also giving a chance to jump on.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Unstoppable Kraken</h3><p><strong>Boss Fight:</strong> The<strong>Kraken</strong> is a giant squid, 300 feet long, that eats boats for some reason or another, probably because of theOverlord. The<strong>Kraken</strong> is a multi-stage boss fight that attacks the heroes while they are on a boat. The following stats apply throughout the entire fight.</p><p><strong>Protect The Ship:</strong> The ship may get torn up during the fight, and people will get thrown off the boat as well. The ship can take damage 4 times before being destroyed. If the ship is destroyed, everyone on it is thrown <strong>Overboard</strong>.</p><p><strong>Overboard:</strong> Anyone knocked off the ship becomes <strong>Overboard</strong>. Anyone who is <strong>Overboard</strong> is removed from the fight and presumed dead (see *<em>Phase 3</em>). Players always get a second chance to avoid being sent <strong>Overboard</strong>.</p><p><strong>Bad Weather:</strong> The waters are choppy, the skies are gray, the fog is thick, and the rain suddenly picks up. Wherever the <strong>Kraken</strong> goes, turmoil follows. Sailing away from the fight will be incredibly difficult with the best of ships, and impossible with most.</p><p><strong>Check Point:</strong> If everyone becomes <strong>Overboard</strong>, skip <strong>Phase 1</strong> on the inevitable rematch.</p><p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> The <strong>Lurker Below:</strong> The <strong>Kraken</strong> initially attacks from beneath the sea, not revealing itself until it must. Its massive tentacles rise up to attack! When at least two of these stats are damaged, you defeat the <strong>Lurker</strong> phase.</p><p><strong>Binding Tentacles:</strong> These tentacles hold the boat in place, slowly crushing it and making escape impossible. When nobody does anything about the binding tentacles for a little while, they damage the ship.</p><p><strong>Grasping Tentacles:</strong> These tentacles slide along the deck of the ship, searching for crew to take to the briny depths below. The Overlord can make a <strong>Hard Cut</strong> at any time to capture someone in these tentacles, but can only capture one person at a time. Anyone who remains captured long enough will go <strong>Overboard</strong>.</p><p><strong>Smashing Tentacles:</strong> Other tentacles slam down on the ship, crushing crew members, cargo, and cannons. When the tentacles smash down, anyone in their way is damaged. If no one is in their way, the ship is damaged.</p><p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> The <strong>Kraken Appears:</strong> The beast rises from the sea, its massive bulbous head and giant yellow eyeball towering over your boat. When these stats are all damaged, the <strong>Kraken</strong> is defeated.</p><p><strong>Loose Debris:</strong> By this point in the fight, the sea is covered in parts of your damaged ship or floating tentacles the <strong>Kraken</strong> has lost. When this phase of the fight starts, immediately damage this stat and return all players who were <strong>Overboard</strong> back to the game, now clinging to debris adrift in the sea.</p><p><strong>Right In The Eye:</strong> This stat can only be damaged by taking out the <strong>Kraken's</strong> eyeball. The eye moves around constantly and cannot easily be hit with Ranged weaponry - someone may need to climb atop the <strong>Kraken</strong> to hit it.</p><p><strong>The Briny Depths:</strong> When the <strong>Kraken</strong> is damaged during this phase, it submerges itself immediately. Anyone on top of it when it dives under water will be sent <strong>Overboard</strong> if they can't hold on or escape before it dives. It will return to the surface on a different side of the ship shortly.</p><p><strong>Return Of The Tentacles:</strong> The <strong>Kraken</strong> can still use all the tentacle Moves from phase 1, but only one of them at a time. It will always use one tentacle attack while hiding underwater, before returning to the surface.</p><p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> <strong>Lost At Sea:</strong> After the <strong>Kraken</strong> is defeated or the boat is destroyed, swing the <strong>Spotlight</strong> to everyone who went <strong>Overboard</strong>. They are trapped on an island somewhere, lost at sea. Go through each of these in order:</p><p><strong>Waterlogged:</strong> Each <strong>Overboard</strong> player loses all of their Food and all of their Gear, except for a single piece of Gear of their choosing.</p><p><strong>Survival Montage:</strong> Each player sent <strong>Overboard</strong> sets a scene about how they solve a survival challenge on the island. Each player who was not sent <strong>Overboard</strong> sets a scene about how they find the island their friends are on so they may continue the adventure. The Overlord sets a scene where they advance each of their plans one step, while the fellowship is out of their way.</p><p><strong>The Rescue:</strong> If there was at least one player who wasn't sent <strong>Overboard</strong>, at this point the rescuers set a scene where they find the <strong>Overboard</strong> players and reunite, ready to continue the adventure.</p><p>If everyone was sent <strong>Overboard</strong>, rescue never comes - everyone sets another scene where they figure out a way to help them get off the island and then put that plan into motion, while the Overlord gets another scene advancing one of their plans another step.</p><h2>The Innocent</h2><p>The Innocent are not related to the Overlord. Most of the time, these threats will be on the fellowship's side of things. But things are never really so black and white as all that, and sometimes your enemies are those who, in better circumstances, would be your friends.</p><ul><li>Advisor: A loyal advisor, well-informed of your kingdom's status at all times, and with plenty of opinions about it too.</li></ul><p>Consultancy: The Advisor is always trying to tell you what to do. If your Wisdom is damaged, they sound extremely convincing, and you will always do what they say.</p><p>Angry Mob: Sometimes things get out of hand. A mob doesn't listen to reason, and is very difficult to handle.</p><p>Out Of Their Minds: They aren't normally like this. Damaging the Mob will lose your Fellowship with this location forever, and you'll never be welcome here again.</p><p>Rage Against The Machine: The mob will destroy whatever their rage is turned against. Talking Sense doesn't work, but anyone loud and passionate enough can redirect their anger. A player trying to control the mob rolls + Blood. <strong>On a 10+,</strong> their anger is now pointed wherever you want it to be. <strong>On a 7-9,</strong> they change the target of their anger, but the Overlord will tell you what they're mad at now. <strong>On a 6-,</strong> you're the new target of their wrath. Charismatic threats can use a Cut to change the target of a mob's wrath, but it takes time.</p><p>Blacksmith: Strong in arm and strong in trade, this trained professional will keep your weaponry in fine condition.</p><p>Spare Weapons: A blacksmith will trade Precious things for weapons.<br />Strong Arm: A blacksmith hits like a truck. When they damage you, you are also knocked down and stunned for a moment.</p><ul><li>Blade Dancer: These graceful warriors specialize in fighting alongside a partner, dancing around their ally as they attack.</li></ul><p>Dance of Death: Anyone who Keeps a Blade Dancer Busy with Melee combat takes one damage.</p><p>Graceful In All Things: When you try to <em>Get Away</em> from a Blade Dancer, they always end up one step ahead of you.</p><ul><li>Big Lug: Real big, real strong, real stupid.</li></ul><p>Bigger 'n You: A Big Lug can pick up enemies and throw them aside with ease. Anyone who Pays a Price near the Big Lug gets tossed.</p><p>Tough As Can Be: This stat has to be damaged twice.</p><ul><li>Bodyguard: A trained bodyguard, ready to dive in the way of an attack.</li></ul><p>Watch Out!!!: The bodyguard can damage this stat to prevent damage to someone else during a fight.</p><ul><li>Brains: The smartest orc you've ever met. They know exactly how to take apart anything you might want them to.</li></ul><p>Clever Plan: The Brains always has an idea. When they are controlling or directing another threat, that threat cannot be stopped by anyone with a damaged Wisdom.</p><p>Tear It Down: The Brains can take apart anything mechanical or architectural, given a little bit of time. They love to sabotage vehicles especially.</p><ul><li>Dwarven Berserker: The strongest and most aggressive of dwarves.</li></ul><p>Blind Rage: The attacks of a Dwarven Berserker on the rampage are very difficult to defend against. If your Grace is damaged, you cannot defend against the attacks of a Dwarven Berserker.</p><p>Reckless Valor: A Dwarven Berserker can damage this stat to damage an enemy they are fighting.</p><ul><li>Dwarven Defender: Trained in the art of the tower shield, this dwarf will defend you through thick and thin.</li></ul><p>Loyal: The defender can damage this stat to prevent damage to someone else.</p><p>Shield-Bearer: The defender and anyone standing next to them cannot be damaged from the front.</p><ul><li>Dwarven Gunner: Dwarven riflemen are famous throughout the world for their excessive use of black powder.</li></ul><p>Powder keg: If this stat is damaged, the gunner explodes, causing collateral damage.</p><p>Sturdy Rifle: When the gunner has an open shot, they may damage this stat to immediately deal damage to anybody. If they can get some time and safety, they heal this stat.</p><ul><li>Elven Archer: An expert with the bow. They say elven archers never miss.</li></ul><p>Perfect Shot: Damage this stat to shoot something out of their hands.<br />An Even More Perfect Shot: Damage this stat to make something ridiculous happen.</p><ul><li>Elven Shadow: If you were to see an Elven Shadow... well. You won't.</li></ul><p>Untraceable: An Elven Shadow trying to hide from or tail the fellowship can only be spotted or found by The Elf or The Orc.</p><p>Right Where You Need Me: The Elven Shadow can damage this stat to be somewhere that is very bad for their enemies right now.</p><ul><li>Fast-Talker: If you'll just listen, you'd understand...</li></ul><p>Mixed-Metaphor-a-Minute: When you listen to a Fast-Talker for too long, your Sense is damaged.</p><p>Natural Charm: Every word that comes out of the Fast-Talker's mouth is gold. If your Sense is damaged, they can distract you for as long as they like.</p><ul><li>Halfling Brave: A more loyal and earnest warrior you will never find.</li></ul><p>Loyal Beyond All Reason: Enemies must damage this stat before they can damage your allies.</p><p>Get Right In There: A Halfling Brave fighting someone cannot be ignored. When you are the Brave's opponent, you are in Despair when trying to do anything except deal with the Brave.</p><ul><li>Halfling Chef: If you've got the food, they'll make it tasty.</li></ul><p>Special Ingredients: They will give you a Halfling Packed Lunch (2 uses, Food, each use feeds 3 people) in exchange for something Precious.</p><p>Rations (Food, 2 uses): Free samples!</p><ul><li>Halfling War Wagon: If you've got the food, they'll make it tasty.</li></ul><p>Rock Ballistae: The War Wagon is Ranged, Dangerous, Reload.<br />Built For War: The War Wagon is Melee, Piercing.<br />Spiked Armor: Anyone trying to board the War Wagon or attack it with melee weaponry takes damage.</p><ul><li>Little Guy: Real small, real good for getting into little places.</li></ul><p>Squeeze In There: The Little Guy can run and hide at any time.<br />Right Where They Need To Be: The Little Guy can damage this stat to be somewhere that is very bad for their enemies right now.</p><p>Politician: They have their own agenda, and it has nothing to do with you or the Overlord. Probably.</p><p>Political Power: Politicians cannot be fought without bringing the whole city down on you, and losing their Fellowship forever.</p><p>Spineless: The Politician will work for whoever gives them the most.</p><ul><li>Powersuit: This mechanized suit is more vehicle than armor. Anyone wearing it is significantly more dangerous than they would otherwise be.</li></ul><p>Powered Movement: The powersuit has rocket-powered boosters, and can leap to anywhere its wearer can see.</p><p>Rocket Fist: The powersuit is Melee, Ranged, and Piercing.<br />Heavy Armor: The first time the powersuit or the person wearing it would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><p>Servant: A maid, butler, or hired hand to<br />carry your things for you.<br />I'll Get That For You: A<br />servant is Useful.</p><h3>Set Piece: Unknown Cnemy!</h3><p><strong>Backer Set Piece</strong></p><p>Everything's Fine: Use this set piece during a standard Downtime scene. Everything seems normal to the players, but unbeknownst to them, someone powerful within this settlement (the mayor, the head of the guard, the college dean, or someone similarly high ranking) is in the Overlord's pocket, and their people are too. When the fellowship makes a Bond with anyone in this place, the Overlord secretly makes a Bond with them, too. This applies for the entire Set Piece.</p><p>Trust Everybody: The people here are particularly friendly. Every players' scene should feature someone trying to get to know them, someone they'd like, or someone trying to worm their way in. Once everyone has done a scene, damage this, and move on to <em>That Was Weird</em>.</p><p><em><strong>That Was Weird</strong></em><strong>:</strong> If the fellowship tries to move on now, something pressing will come up requiring their attention. An NPC will need their help, or a few minions of the Overlord will attack from the middle of the settlement.</p><p>Pressing Matter: Tell the fellowship their next few scenes must relate to helping solve the problem. NPCs they've made Bonds with will show up to help, if able. When it's solved, damage this stat.</p><p>That Was Convenient: During the Overlord's turn to set a scene, they can heal the Pressing Matter stat and make a new problem to solve. When the players attempt to leave this place, damage this stat and move on to <em>You'll Never Leave</em>.</p><p><em><strong>You'll Never Leave</strong></em><strong>:</strong> The important figure is forced to reveal themselves they are a pawn of the Overlord, and its been their job to keep you here as long as possible. The lines \"I tried to be reasonable\" and \"playing hero\" should come up. Put an Angry Mob into play, and a Politician or Advisor to represent the mastermind. The Mob's initial goal is to keep their heroes here.</p><p>Wait! Don't Go!: At any time, anyone the fellowship made a Bond with can show up and erase one of their Bonds with the fellowship. When they do, they reveal an Overlord Bond they hold, give Despair to the person they've betrayed, and then make a Hard Cut against them.</p><p>This set piece ends when the Overlord's pawn has been defeated and the angry mob's wrath quelled, or when the players manage to escape the settlement once and for all. Unless they exposed the Overlord's pawn to the people, any Fellowship they had here is lost forever. Either way, the enemies made here will persist for as long as they live.</p><h2>The Horde</h2><p>The Horde is one of the Armies of the Overlord, and the Overlord has access to these threats when they control this army. The Horde specializes in swarm tactics and large numbers. Each individual threat is easily handled, but you will never face only one. Hordes often appear in Groups and Gangs - their numbers are never to be underestimated.</p><ul><li>Tiny Swarm: A cluster of small enemies, each the size of your fist. Spiders, rats, beetles, zombie hands - whatever they are, they get all over the place and make your life much harder than it should be.</li></ul><p>Climb All Over: Anyone the cluster swarms on is in Despair, and you cannot <em>Get Away</em> once they are on you. The Little Swarm can climb on any surface and fit through small gaps.</p><p>Flying Swarm: A large number of flying things, getting all over the place. Bats, bees, winged monkeys - whatever they are, they make escape difficult.</p><p>Cover Everywhere: Anyone trying to <em>Get Away</em> from a place with a Flying Swarm must Pay a Price first.</p><ul><li>Little Swarm: A cluster of enemies, smaller than most. Kobolds, goblins, monkeys, froglings, ratlings - whatever they are, they easily surround their foes and poke them with sharp sticks or shoddy swords.</li></ul><p>Outnumbered: The Little Swarm always outnumbers their foes, and you cannot <em>Keep Them Busy</em> without a narrow choke point.</p><ul><li>Warrior's Swarm: A number of warriors armed with a variety of Melee weaponry. Lizardfolk, bug-bears, ogres, nagas - whatever they are, they will easily overpower anyone one-on-one.</li></ul><p>Overpowering: Anyone trying to act alone against the Warrior's Swarm must Pay A Price first.</p><p>Swarm of Arrows: A contingent of archers, sling throwers, javelineers, or firecasters. The ammo they use is crude and ineffective, but there is a lot of it.</p><p>Covering Fire: Anyone being targeted by a Swarm of Arrows cannot take action out in the open without Paying a Price. The archers can only target one person at a time, or two if they are right next to each other.</p><ul><li>The Fool: This minion can't do anything right.</li></ul><p>Relief: When a different threat would be damaged or defeated, destroy this minion instead in a hilariously over-the-top way.</p><ul><li>The Standout: Somehow, this one stands out from the rest. They get a dramatic camera angle and a name, and they step up to the plate to do what the rest of the swarm cannot.</li></ul><p>I Can Do It!: This one can do what none of the others can. Damage this stat to have the swarm make an immediate Hard Cut.</p><p>Did I Do Good?: If the Standout survives the scene, they'll come back in the next swarm.</p><ul><li>The Task Master: A cruel overseer who drives their forces onward.</li></ul><p>Die In Vain: When the fellowship rolls a 7-9 against another threat, the Task Master may damage that threat to make that roll a 6-.</p><p>Break A Few Eggs: When the Task Master would take damage, deal that damage to a minion within the Task Master's reach.</p><ul><li>True Warrior: The warrior's swarm is mostly interchangeable, but among them lives a hero. The one who gives them hope, the one they all look up to, they one they can always count on. The True Warrior.</li></ul><p>Unrivaled: This enemy can only show up with the Cut show signs of an approaching threat. Their attacks are Hard Cuts.</p><p>Unbeatable: The True Warrior cannot take damage (although they can be destroyed). When the True Warrior deals damage, they send the one they hurt flying out of their way.</p><ul><li>The War Leader: A masterful commander who unites the swarm and keeps it together under duress.</li></ul><p>Hold Together!: This stat must be damaged twice. The War Leader can take damage in place of any Swarm they lead.</p><h3>Set Piece: Cime To Gol</h3><ul><li>One Way Out: The fellowship has been cornered in some kind of architecture by the minions of the Overlord, and they must escape by any means necessary.</li></ul><p>Long Way To Go: There's a lot of ground between the fellowship and the exit. When the fellowship defeats the Obstacle Course, damage this stat.</p><p>There's The Exit!: After you've damaged Long Way To Go, the exit is in sight! But everything else is now in their way. When the fellowship takes a clever way out or defeats the Endless Horde, damage this stat and they escape.</p><p>Endless Horde: The Horde will not stop until the fellowship escapes.<br />From Above!: A Tiny Swarm or Swarm of Arrows is on the scene. When they are defeated while this stat is undamaged, the other swarm appears.</p><p>From Behind!: A Little Swarm or Warrior's Swarm is always trailing behind the fellowship, and will catch any stragglers. When they are defeated while this stat is undamaged, the other swarm appears.</p><ul><li>Obstacle Course: There is a lot of ground between the fellowship and the exit, with a few unique obstacles along the way. They can face these obstacles in any order - once the fellowship has beaten three of these threats, they have defeated the Obstacle Course.</li></ul><p>The Bottleneck: There is a narrow passage that only one or two can get through at a time. Once everyone is through, damage this stat.</p><p>The Collapsing Bridge: There is a narrow bridge in their way, which will begin collapsing once they run onto it. Anyone who cannot keep up will fall into the waters below. Once everyone is through or has been dunked, damage this stat. The players who have been dunked and the ones who made it across will face different Obstacles next. The party will meet up again after beating both of those Obstacles.</p><p>The Distraction: This room is loaded with treasure. Anyone who stops to loot gets something valuable (1 use, Precious), but they also get caught by the Endless Horde behind them. Once everyone is through, damage this stat.</p><p>The Really Big Room: When the fellowship gets here, the two swarms they are not currently fighting from the Endless Horde are in front of them! Once they get through this room, damage this stat.</p><p>The Spooky Place: This place is creepy and dark. Everyone here whose Courage is damaged is in Despair. Once everyone is through, damage this stat.</p><p>The True Threat: A dangerous creature lives down here. At some point, it will find you. When the fellowship gets to this threat, a Titan appears in front of them. If they defeat it or <em>Get Away</em> from it, damage this stat.</p><h2>The Organización</h2><p>The Organization is one of the Armies of the Overlord, and the Overlord has access to these threats when they control this army. The Organization is a small, elite group, each with their own unique skills and abilities. The Organization has only one of each of the following Threats, but these Threats are very good at living to see another day. They will tail the fellowship all through their journey. Name each member of the Organization.</p><ul><li>Brainiac: This one's a genius, and they want you to know it.</li></ul><p>Chess Pieces: When the Brainiac would be damaged while an ally is around, the ally takes the hit instead.</p><p>Part of the Plan: When something goes wrong, damage this stat to make a Hard Cut immediately. If the Brainiac still has Chess Pieces, they can damage an ally instead of damaging this stat.</p><p>Too Clever For Their Own Good: The Brainiac will always pause to gloat and monologue when things go their way.</p><p>Cutthroat: This one wants to win, no matter what it takes.<br />A Challenger Approaches: The Cutthroat will never turn down a challenge, and they will not fight you if they think they can win through a contest of speed, strength, skill, or luck instead.</p><p>I Always Win!: During a contest, the Cutthroat's Cuts are Hard Cuts.<br />Is That All You Got?: When the Cutthroat would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat first.</p><ul><li>Mage Knight: This warrior has no peer in combat of any kind.</li></ul><p>Arrogant: Anyone who sings the praises of the Mage Knight can <em>Keep Them Busy</em> as if they got a 10+ without rolling.</p><p>Counter Spell: The Mage Knight cannot be Kept Busy or damaged by magic or ranged weapons.</p><p>Spell Sword: When the Mage Knight is trying to fight you, anyone who gets close to them must Pay a Price to do so.</p><p>Honor-Bound: The most noble and generous of the bunch, they have a strict moral code they will not break. This code grants them unbelievable strength.</p><p>For My Honor: The Honor-Bound cannot be defeated or Taken Out. This stat cannot be damaged unless the Honor-Bound breaks their code. If they do, they are immediately Taken Out and will not fight for the rest of the scene.</p><p>Mercy: The Honor-Bound will always show mercy and compassion, even to their enemies. The first time a member of the fellowship honors their code, the Honor-Bound will honor a request they make. When the Honor-Bound is tricked, deceived, or betrayed by someone in the fellowship, damage this stat.</p><p>Unrelenting: The Honor-Bound deals damage to anyone <em>Keeping Them Busy</em>. The Honor-Bound deals damage twice to anyone who damages them.</p><p>Monster: This massive creature is smarter than it looks and eager to prove its worth.</p><p>Big And Scary: Anyone trying to act against Monster is in Despair.<br />Caught One!: When Monster deals damage, they also pick up and grab the person they damaged. If they are not stopped, they'll walk off with them.</p><p>Eager To Please: Monster is trying their best and just wants to be loved. Anyone who is nice to Monster immediately forms a Bond with Monster. When Monster is harmed, erase all Bonds the fellowship has with Monster. Monster will not join the fellowship as a Companion unless someone can form three Bonds with them.</p><ul><li>Sharpshooter: No one can shoot more true than this sniper.</li></ul><p>Eagle Eye: The Sharpshooter can see you coming from a mile away, and attack from great distances. The Sharpshooter's first attack against the group is always a Hard Cut.</p><p>Trick Shot: The Sharpshooter can damage this stat to make a player fail a <em>Finish Them</em> attempt.</p><p>Social Anxiety: The Sharpshooter is no good at social situations and runs from people trying to talk to them.</p><ul><li>Speedy: The fastest of them all. Get in, get what you need, get out.</li></ul><p>Too Scared: When Speedy gets damaged, they immediately run away.<br />Too Sharp: Anyone trying to <em>Get Away</em> from Speedy is stopped before they roll.</p><p>Too Quick: Speedy can always steal small items right off your person as long as they aren't in your hands. Speedy can get anywhere they need to be without any problems - nothing short of solid walls will slow them down.</p><ul><li>Tough Guy: The strong, stoic, angry one, who can take a hit like nobody else and make sure you regret trying.</li></ul><p>Built Strong: When the Tough Guy is damaged, they deal damage back.<br />Invincible: This stat needs to be damaged three times to Take Out the Tough Guy.</p><p>Simple-Minded: The Tough Guy loves one thing and one thing only, and they are easily distracted or persuaded by that one thing.</p><ul><li>Trickster: You never know what this wily rogue will do next.</li></ul><p>The Trickster's stats are Secret.<br />Not What It Seems: When the Trickster appears in a scene, immediately reveal an unwelcome truth. You may damage this stat to immediately reveal an unwelcome truth. These truths are Hard Cuts.</p><p>Lies and Make Believe: When the Trickster is present or nearby, whenever the players <em>Speak Softly</em> or <em>Look Closely</em>, one of their questions will be answered with a lie. Do not tell them that any of the answers are lies.</p><p>Coward: The Trickster will never fight or deal damage if they can help it. If the Trickster takes damage, they immediately disappear from the scene and won't be back until they recover.</p><p>Wizard: Wizards are known for two things: Supreme power and zero responsibility.</p><p>No Sense of Right and Wrong: The Wizard is Dangerous and their actions always cause collateral damage of some kind, no matter what they do. When the Wizard harms a member of the fellowship, that player will tell you what else happened as a result of the spell.</p><p>Kaboom!: The Wizard can deal damage as a Hard Cut to anyone they like.<br />Mage Armor: The Wizard can only be harmed by magic.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Spores Cournament</h3><ul><li>The Championship: Something important is the grand prize - a Source of Power, or the Fellowship of this sports-obsessed community, or something the fellowship absolutely needs in order to continue their quest. Whatever the case, the fellowship has to enter the sports tournament, and the Organization will meet them in the finals!</li></ul><p>Tournament Rules: If the fellowship breaks the rules, they may be disqualified! Everyone gets one warning, but a second rules-breaking will put that player on the sidelines for the rest of that game.</p><p>The Grand Prize: The winner of the tournament gets something extremely valuable for their cause. If the fellowship wins, on top of their prize, one of them Levels Up. If the Organization wins, the Overlord Levels Up, even if they are the highest Level character.</p><p>The Preliminaries: The fellowship has to play several rounds before the finals, but we only need to play out one of those games. This is the tutorial.</p><p>Figure Out the Rules: Each player (including the Overlord) will tell us one or two rules on how to play this sport. It's important to make sure you have rules on how to score points, how to penalize players, and at least one gotcha-type weird restrictive rule. After everyone has made a rule or two, damage this stat.</p><p>Buncha Nobodies: The fellowship is new to this game, so no one really understands everything about what they're supposed to be doing (except that one player who is really into sports). The Overlord may damage this stat at any time to change a rule, having the fellowship realize they were playing the game wrong this whole time.</p><p>Quick Turn-Around: As soon as the fellowship manages to secure a lead after the rules change, skip the rest of the game and they win the Preliminaries.</p><ul><li>Rival Battle: The Organization is here to stop you, and they mean business! If the fellowship doesn't play hard, work together, and damage some of these stats, they cannot win.</li></ul><p>The Rivalry: The member of the fellowship who is the most into the game has a Rival. Their Rival will constantly get in their way all the time throughout the whole game.</p><p>Superiority: The Organization's team is better at this game than you are. Each time you score, they score right back.</p><p>Cheating: At least one member of the Organization is cheating, but they won't get caught by the ref. The Organization will pull ahead in points very quickly if the fellowship doesn't do something about it.</p><h2>The Scourge</h2><p>The Scourge is one of the Armies of the Overlord, and the Overlord has access to these threats when they control this army. The Scourge is all about corruption and spreading. Areas under the Overlord's control become tainted, dark places, where life as we know it cannot exist. The Scourge destroys and replaces whatever is in its path. These threats don't go out as much as others do, and will mostly be found in or near places the Overlord already controls.</p><p>Many Scourge threats corrupt and control other things. You can use any threats from any other category by making them Blighted, Skeletonized, or Zombified. The Scourge rarely exists except in and around their zones, so untainted areas are perfectly safe right up until they aren't anymore.</p><ul><li>Blighted: An ordinary creature that has spent too long within the Corruption becomes Blighted. They are tainted and wrong now, and seek to spread their blight. Replace one of their stats with Corrosive Touch:</li></ul><p>Corrosive Touch: Anything trying to touch a Blighted must pay a price.</p><ul><li>Chaos Beast: A gibbering, spitting, ooze-like monster that is grown from the Corruption that taints the world. It has as many hands, eyes, and teeth as it needs, and its needs vary from moment to moment.</li></ul><p>Corrosive Touch: Anything trying to touch a Chaos Beast must pay a price.</p><p>Amorphous Thing: The Chaos Beast is formless, and can squeeze through any gap. It is constantly changing shape, producing new limbs and mouths and eyes constantly. Anyone who sticks around near a Chaos Beast has their Sense damaged.</p><ul><li>Corruption: A spreading blight. This is an environmental threat that slowly grows, and it is a visual representation of the Overlord's influence.</li></ul><p>Corrosive Field: Anything that enters the Corruption that isn't part of The Scourge must pay a price.</p><p>Long Term Problem: The spread of Corruption can be held off by containing or damaging it, perhaps with fire or thick barricades of sand or stone, but it cannot be stopped permanently without stopping The Overlord.</p><ul><li>Nightmaw: A shadowbeast that hungers like no other.</li></ul><p>Shadows: The Nightmaw can only move through shadows, along the surface. It cannot form in total darkness, and it cannot touch anything off the ground or in the light. It can only be harmed by fire and direct sunlight.</p><p>Hunger: Whenever Nightmaw deals damage, it gains Armor (1 Use).</p><ul><li>Skeleton: An agile pile of bones, usually armed, sometimes armored, often cackling, always trouble.</li></ul><p>Just Bones: Skeletons do not take damage from anything that would slip right through them or is made to harm flesh. Most piercing weapons, ranged weapons, slashing weapons, and poison or fire-based attacks will have very little effect on a Skeleton.</p><p>Weapons Training: Skeletons almost always carry a weapon of some kind. A skeleton has a single tag from this list: Armor (1 Use), Piercing, or Ranged.</p><ul><li>Skeletonized: A beast's skeleton, brought back to life and clinging to this world. Replace one of their stats with Just Bones:</li></ul><p>Just Bones: Skeletons do not take damage from anything that would slip right through them or is made to harm flesh. Most piercing weapons, ranged weapons, slashing weapons, and poison or fire-based attacks will have very little effect on a Skeleton.</p><h3>Zombies: Shamble. Hunt. Lunge. Eat. Braaaains.</h3><p>Painless: Zombies do not stop attacking until they are destroyed. If they take damage while all of their stats are already damaged, they are destroyed.</p><p>Simpleton Hivemind: A group of zombies acts as a single unit, moving as one towards the nearest source of living meat. They are easily duped and confused - when this stat is damaged, the group breaks up and cannot focus on anything that isn't within arm's reach.</p><ul><li><p>Zombified: Give this to any other creature to make it into a zombie version of itself. Use this for any monster that's still dangerous for its own reasons.<br />Replace one of their stats with Painless:<br />Painless: Zombies do not stop attacking until they are destroyed. If they take damage while all of their stats are already damaged, they are destroyed.</p></li></ul><h3>Set Piece: Remove Corruprion</h3><ul><li>Too Close For Comfort: A field of corruption has grown in far too close to something extremely important for the success of the fellowship, and it must be destroyed at its core... or at least pushed back long enough for the fellowship to get what they need here.</li></ul><p>Everything's Dangerous: There is nowhere safe within the corruption. You cannot <em>Fill Your Belly</em> here without leaving or finding a pocket space that is not corrupted. This stat cannot be damaged.</p><p>Dark Creatures: No matter where they go, zombies and the blighttouched are always nearby. This stat cannot be damaged.</p><p>Corrupted Place: This place used to be something, it used to mean something. But not anymore. Tell us whose People this place used to belong to. That player can <em>Command Lore</em> about the architecture and layout of this place, although everything is slightly different than they expect it to be.</p><p>A Place of Memories: Somewhere in here is something beautiful and important to their People. The Overlord may damage this stat to reveal something to the player whose People this place belonged to, dealing damage to them. Whether or not they share what they saw with the others is up to them.</p><p>Sealed Path: The player who knows this place will never get lost, but there will be a point where the path they need is covered in corruption. It is collapsed and corrosive and conventional means through don't work properly. When everyone is through, damage this stat.</p><p>The Heart of Darkness: Deep within the corruption is a crystal heart from which the corruption spreads. When the fellowship gets through this Corrupted Place, they find the heart. Kill the heart, and the field of corruption will slowly die. But be wary: the area around the heart is swarming with zombies and Chaos Beasts.</p><p>Thick With Corruption: The air itself is corrosive and deadly, this close to the heart. The first time someone gets close enough to touch the heart, they take damage.</p><p>The Heart Itself: The heart is far more durable than anyone would like it to be. This stat must be damaged three times to destroy it. The first time it is damaged, it is simply knocked loose. Carrying the heart outside of the corruption will also destroy the corrupted zone, but new corruption will spread from the heart as you go, and carrying it is very dangerous - each new scene it will deal damage to the person carrying it, and it also damages anyone it is handed off to. If the heart is not destroyed, it will create a new zone.</p><h2>The Titans</h2><p>The Titans are one of the Armies of the Overlord, and the Overlord has access to these threats when they control this army. The Titans are extremely powerful, but they always work alone. You will never find a Titan working with another Titan, although they may team up with other kinds of threats.</p><p>An Army of Titans simply does not happen. The Overlord's Army is a Gang of Titans instead.</p><p><strong>Cloud Giant:</strong> These warriors are 3 or 4 times as tall as the average elf or human. Cloud Giants can walk along the sky and run across the wind, but they lack some of the durability of other giants.</p><p><strong>Windrunner:</strong> Cloud Giants can fly, and their attacks send enemies flying along the wind. Cloud Giants will never go in-doors if they can help it.</p><p><em><strong>Like Flies</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Anyone who fails a roll or pays a price while on top of a Cloud Giant is swatted off, in addition to the usual consequences.</p><p><strong>Fire Giant:</strong> These warriors are 3 or 4 times as tall as the average elf or human. Fire Giants are immune to flames and make their homes in volcanoes. They fight by setting themselves on fire before moving in with their fists.</p><p><strong>Crushing Blow:</strong> Anyone damaged by a giant takes two damage.<br /><strong>Wildfire:</strong> The fire giant is Burning and Dangerous.<br /><em><strong>Like Flies</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Anyone who fails a roll or pays a price while on top of a Giant is swatted off, in addition to the usual consequences.</p><p><strong>Fire Golem:</strong> A 10 foot tall being of molten rock, perpetually on fire.<br /><strong>Burning Aura:</strong> Anyone who is not immune to fire cannot get close without paying a price.</p><p><strong>Wildfire:</strong> The fire golem is Burning and Dangerous.<br /><strong>Tough As Nails:</strong> The first time a Fire Golem would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><p><em><strong>Giant</strong></em><strong>:</strong> These warriors are 3 or 4 times as tall as the average elf or human. Giants are the most social of all Titans, and they will occasionally work together when the need is great enough.</p><p><strong>Crushing Blow:</strong> Anyone damaged by a giant takes two damage.<br /><strong>Proper Weapons:</strong> A Giant wields well-crafted weaponry that suits their style. Their attacks have either the Area, Ranged, or Piercing tag, choose one.</p><p><em><strong>Like Flies</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Anyone who fails a roll or pays a price while on top of a Giant is swatted off, in addition to the usual consequences.</p><p><em><strong>Ogre</strong></em><strong>:</strong> A simple creature, an Ogre is easily confused and easily misled. But just as easily, they will destroy your house or crush your head. Ogres often work with a pack of wolves or a pet varg.</p><p><strong>Giant's Strength:</strong> Anyone damaged by an Ogre is knocked prone and momentarily stunned.</p><p><strong>Huge Club:</strong> The Ogre's attacks are Dangerous while it is armed.<br /><strong>Tough As Nails:</strong> The first time an Ogre would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><p><strong>A Simple Mind:</strong> Ogres are easily tricked by anything Precious or flashy.</p><p><em><strong>Sky Serpent</strong></em><strong>:</strong> This winged snake is 100 feet long. It will rarely fight by itself, but other Titans will ride upon it into battle.</p><p><strong>Drop Off:</strong> The Sky Serpent will regularly drop other Titans into the scene if it is not dissuaded by heavy artillery or by magical means.</p><p><strong>Mostly Peaceful:</strong> The Sky Serpent is large enough to crush its foes beneath it, and its attacks are Dangerous, but it will never attack living things. It will crush buildings and strike out against vehicles and city defenses, but it will only ever harm little folk by mistake.</p><p><strong>Stone Golem:</strong> A magical construct of earth and iron. Its durability is maximum.<br /><strong>Stonewalled:</strong> A Stone Golem can completely block off a passageway just by standing in it.</p><p><strong>Crumbling:</strong> When this stat is damaged, a large part of the Stone Golem falls off, potentially damaging whoever is closest to it.</p><p><strong>Tough As Nails:</strong> The first time a Stone Golem would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><p><strong>Water Golem:</strong> Magic is used to hold this being of liquid into a humanoid shape, empowering it to serve its master.</p><p><strong>Drowning:</strong> A Water Golem attacks by surrounding its enemies in water. Anyone caught by it risks suffocation.</p><p><strong>Aqueous:</strong> A Water Golem can fit through gaps of any size, and it is completely invisible inside a body of water.</p><p><strong>Tough As Nails:</strong> The first time a Water Golem would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Stone Colossus</h3><p><strong>Army of One:</strong> A giant statue of stone, brought to life and used as a machine of war. Its defenses are many, and its weapons carry several tons of stone behind each blow. If either of these stats are damaged, the Colossus is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Massive Stone Body:</strong> The Colossus's massive body is built to last. This stat cannot be damaged by anything less than siege weaponry and high explosives. If this stat is damaged, the Colossus falls over, and everyone near it risks being crushed.</p><p><strong>Power Core:</strong> The Colossus has a weak point deep inside of it - a mechanical or magical core that powers it. Anyone near the core risks being set on fire by its intense heat. If this stat is damaged, the Colossus falls apart, and everyone inside it risks being crushed.</p><p><strong>Armored Exterior:</strong> The Colossus is nearly invincible. If you don't deal with its thick outer shell of stone, you cannot hope to stop it for good.</p><p><strong>Six Feet of Stone:</strong> The Colossus' armor is several feet thick, and cannot be damaged by anything less than siege weaponry and high explosives. Unless this stat is damaged, you cannot harm the Colossus' Massive Stone Body.</p><p><strong>Maintenance Tunnel:</strong> There is a secret entrance into the Colossus, but it is well hidden, hard to reach, and locked. Unless this stat is damaged, you cannot reach the Colossus' Power Core.</p><p><em><strong>Hands of God</strong></em><strong>:</strong> The Colossus' massive arms and legs are its main threat. They can crush you like a fly, and stopping them requires some serious firepower of your own.</p><p><strong>This Right Hand Of Mine:</strong> The right arm of the Colossus holds a massive sword, which can be used to destroy anything it can hit. It swings slowly, but the blow covers such a large area it can be difficult to dodge. Anyone directly hit by this weapon is Taken Out, damaging all of their stats.</p><p><strong>The Left Arm:</strong> The left arm of the Colossus is free, but it can use it to swat off anyone trying to harm it. Climbing the Colossus is dangerous while this arm is functional.</p><p><strong>Pillars of Stone:</strong> The legs of the Colossus can crush anything underfoot. The Colossus can simply walk through anything in its path, destroying all vehicles and structures that get in the way, and it leaves massive footprints wherever it goes. If this stat is damaged, the Colossus becomes immobile, and crashes to the ground, potentially crushing anyone below it.</p><h2>The Overlord's Elite</h2><p>These threats are powerful bosses and set pieces available to any Overlord. They make excellent Generals.</p><p><em><strong>The Warmonger</strong></em><strong>:</strong> This powerful warrior wants a fight, real bad, and won't take no for an answer. If you meet them, they're going to fight you, end of story.</p><p><strong>Unstoppable:</strong> The Warmonger's attacks are always Hard Cuts and cannot be <em>Overcome</em>.</p><p><strong>Wildly Reckless:</strong> When the fellowship Keeps Them Busy, the person keeping the Warmonger busy decides the targets of the Warmonger's Cuts.</p><p><strong>Tough As Nails:</strong> The first time the Warmonger would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><p><em><strong>The Captain</strong></em><strong>:</strong> The Captain leads a well-trained squad, keeping them in line and making certain they aren't led astray. A crew led by a Captain is far more clever and dangerous than your typical gang of baddies.</p><p><strong>Devoted Underlings:</strong> Anyone trying to harm or distract the Captain does that to one of the Captain's allies instead. The Captain is only vulnerable while alone.</p><p><strong>Leadership:</strong> The Captain's allies cannot be distracted, confused, or separated while the Captain is with them. Elite Troopers under their command can deal damage to members of the fellowship.</p><p><em><strong>Elite Trooper</strong></em><strong>:</strong> An elite soldier, who inexplicably goes down super easily and without any trouble. They are usually found in a Group or a Gang and mostly exist to be very intimidating. A Captain makes them much scarier.</p><p><strong>Storm Trooper:</strong> Elite Troopers never deal damage to the fellowship. They automatically capture anyone they can surround and separate from the group.</p><p><strong>Intimidating Armor:</strong> No one outside the fellowship will willingly go anywhere guarded by Elite Troopers. When you damage this stat, you may take their armor and wear it as a disguise.</p><h3>Set Piece: The Lying Castle</h3><p><strong>Backer Set Piece</strong></p><p><em><strong>Flying Fortress</strong></em><strong>:</strong> This massive fortress houses a source of power that the Overlord has used to devastating effect. Somehow, the fellowship needs to get up there and stop it, and it will NOT be easy. The players should know about this set piece long before they ever come close to trying to deal with it.</p><p><strong>Flight:</strong> Most of the time, the Flying Castle is completely inaccessible due to its extreme altitude. Merely finding a way up there is an adventure all its own. Anywhere the castle is, the Overlord's minions are sure to follow.</p><p><strong>Artillery Fire:</strong> The Flying Castle has powerful anti-ground artillery weapons, and can devastate a city very quickly, if it needs to. The Overlord can damage this stat to wipe a city off the map, removing any Fellowship held there. The Overlord can only heal this stat using a Victory.</p><p><em><strong>The Castle Proper</strong></em><strong>:</strong> The castle is massive and difficult to navigate, and Elite Troopers are around every corner.</p><p><strong>Oops:</strong> Damage this stat at any time to have someone get found by an entire platoon of Elite Troopers. Capture is inevitable.</p><p><strong>Traps!:</strong> Choose two or three Barrier threats to get in the way while the fellowship tries to get through the castle.</p><p><strong>The Map:</strong> Somewhere in here is a map of the castle. Without it, it is impossible to find the Power Core. When they find it, they also notice something else important here - an important captive, a vault of treasures, or something of similar value, but it is well out of their way, and something big is guarding it. Once they have the map, damage this stat, and the fellowship can safely go anywhere in the castle without being found.</p><p><em><strong>Power Core</strong></em><strong>:</strong> The castle remains flying from the Source of Power hidden somewhere within it, and this source has many protections keeping it safe.</p><p><strong>The Guardian:</strong> There is only one way into the Power Core room, and it is guarded by an elite warrior. Choose a threat from the Organization to guard it. This is a new threat - if your army is The Organization, the guardian is related to the member whose threat type they share.</p><p><strong>High Radiation:</strong> The power source is extremely dangerous. You must pay a price to enter its room, and you must pay a price every time you take action within the room housing the Power Core.</p><p><strong>Too Much Power:</strong> The Source of Power cannot be destroyed by simply attacking it - it needs to be overloaded, drained, or taken, and all of those will have consequences. Immediately make a Hard Cut against whoever takes care of the Power Core. No matter how the Power Core is taken out, the flying castle will immediately stop flying once it is, and begin to fall from the sky.</p><p><strong>Escape Sequence:</strong> The castle is falling! If you don't get out now, you're done for!</p><p><strong>Structural Failure:</strong> The whole place is falling apart! You can make Hard Cuts to cut off the path or separate the group as often as you want. When everyone in the fellowship is alone or with only one other person, damage this stat.</p><p><strong>Every Man For Themselves:</strong> The remaining enemies here will not bar your way unless they are extremely determined to see you dead. The fellowship can conscript the help of anyone who wants to live to try and escape together.</p><p><strong>Final Countdown:</strong> Set a countdown timer equal to half the number of players, rounded up. Each time a group escapes the castle, tick the timer down 1. When the timer hits 0, the castle crashes, and anyone still inside is Taken Out.</p>"

Every player has their own unique list of Advancements.</p><p>An Advantage is anything you have that lets you outplay someone. You need to hold an advantage in order to <em>Finish Them</em>.</p><p>An <strong>Agenda</strong> is a story-telling guideline. Each player will have a list of Agendas on their character sheet. When you don't know what your character should do next, you should look to their Agendas for ideas.</p><p>Ammo is an abstraction for how many shots you have left with a ranged weapon.

Some moves, such as <em>Keep Them Busy</em> and <em>Finish Them</em>, will make you spend Ammo to perform them.</p><p><strong>Area</strong> weapons are powerful but rare, and hit everything in a big area near where they hit.

It is used to <em>Overcome</em> adversity and represents power, endurance, passion, and pride.</p><p>A <strong>Bond</strong> is a single sentence describing your character's relationship with someone else in the story. Bonds can change and be added to during the course of your adventure. You can never have more than 3 Bonds with someone else.</p><p><strong>Burning</strong> attacks or weapons can start fires.</p><p>A <strong>Check</strong> is a part of a move that tells you what you need to do to see results. A Check may require you to pay a price, or spend something, or, usually, roll the dice. When a Check requires dice rolling, it will list a stat that gives a bonus to your roll, like Blood or Courage.</p><p>Clumsy items are hard to use properly, and give -1 to any rolls to use them. Clumsy Armor gives you -1 to rolls to <em>Get Away</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Command Lore</strong></em> is a special move that gives every player absolute control over their people and their peoples' place in the world.</p><p>Companions are allies of the fellowship who have tagged along to help. If no one has any Bonds with a companion, they leave the fellowship.</p><p>Courage is one of the core stats of the fellowship. It is used in the basic move <em>Keep Them Busy</em> and represents luck, fearlessness, inspiration, and strength of spirit.</p><p>A Cut is a story-telling weapon the Overlord wields against the fellowship. Only the Overlord knows the details of their Cuts.</p><p><strong>Damage</strong> dealt to the fellowship will make them roll in Despair when using the damaged stat. Damage dealt to an enemy will remove one of their Threats. Damage is not necessarily violence - damage represents any means of preventing a threat from being threatening, and can also represent hardship, pain, or negative emotions. When damage is dealt to someone who cannot take it, they are Taken Out or Destroyed, with whatever that means.</p><p><em>Dangerous</em> weapons and items cause lots of collateral damage. This functions like the Area tag but less controlled.</p><p><strong>Despair</strong> is a penalty you have sometimes. When you have Despair, you roll three dice and take the worst two. Hope and Despair cancel out.</p><p>A <strong>Destiny Playbook</strong> is an advanced playbook for members of the fellowship. You earn a Destiny by taking the You Have Changed advance after reaching level 5, and you can only ever have one Destiny.</p><p>Something that is <strong>Destroyed</strong> will never again get in the way of the fellowship, for one reason or another. Players are never destroyed - when a member of the fellowship would be destroyed, they are Taken Out instead. Some moves will tell you to destroy them, which instantly causes this effect.</p><p><em>Drunk</em> is an item tag for an item that fills you with Despair on your next roll. You cannot hold Hope while Drunk.</p><p><strong>The Dwarf</strong> is one of the heroes of the fellowship. They have a unique stat, Iron, and they are very tough and strong.</p><p><em>Dwarf-Made</em> items are indestructible, except by dragon's fire or secrets known only to the dwarves.</p><p><strong>The Elf</strong> is one of the heroes of the fellowship. They have innate talents some might mistake for magic, and they are very graceful.</p><p><em>Elf-Made</em> items never age, and anyone who is not an elf or a friend of elves is burned by the touch of Elf-Made items.</p><p><em><strong>End of Session</strong></em> is a special move that rewards the players for doing the things that Fellowship is all about. It rewards them with healing, restored Gear, and the opportunity to level up.</p><p><strong>Fellowship</strong>, capitalized, is the reward you get from earning the trust of a community in peril. This gives you a Fellowship move and a safe place to stay.</p><p><em><strong>Fellowship</strong></em>, capitalized and in <em>italics</em>, is the name of this book you are holding and the game you are playing.</p><p>The <strong>fellowship</strong>, lowercase, is the group of players trying to defeat the Overlord. It refers to both the players and the heroes they are playing as.</p><p><em>Fill Your Belly</em> is a special move that lets you heal by eating food between scenes. When you eat together with your friends, the meal is more satisfying, and restores more morale. Filly your billy.</p><p><em><strong>Finish Them</strong></em> is a basic move that uses any stat. It is the only basic move that deals damage to your enemies, and it requires an Advantage to perform.</p><p>Food is required for Filling Your Belly and is the main way to heal damage you have taken. You can only eat between scenes.</p><p><em><strong>Forge a Bond</strong></em> is a special move that gives players the ability to form a Bond with anyone they share a moment with. What counts as a moment is up to the person forging the bond - if you find something meaningful, then it is.</p><p><strong>Framework Playbooks</strong> define the rules of the game, giving the players an end goal and giving the player in charge of the Framework the rules they need to run the game. The Overlord is a Framework playbook.</p><p>A <strong>Gang</strong> is formed when at least 30 enemies are working together. Their attacks and moves can target everyone at once, making them very dangerous. When a Gang is defeated, it is replaced with two Groups.</p><p><strong>Gear</strong> is a fundamental part of each member of the fellowship. Your Gear restores to its starting values whenever the fellowship <em>Recovers</em>. Anything you pick up that is not a part of your Gear doesn't become part of your Gear - it is just extra stuff you have, and is lost forever after being used.</p><p><em><strong>Get Away</strong></em> is a basic move that rolls +Grace. It is used to hide or escape from a situation you no longer want to be in.</p><p>Grace is one of the core stats of the fellowship. It is used in the basic moves <em>Get Away</em> and <em>Talk Sense</em> and represents eloquence, speed, and style.</p><p>A Group is formed when at least 3 enemies are working together. Their attacks and moves can target two people at once, making them very dangerous. When a Group is defeated, it is replaced with two solo threats.</p><p><strong>The Halfling</strong> is one of the heroes of the fellowship. They use their small size to their advantage, and they are very courageous.</p><p><strong>The Harbinger</strong> is one of the heroes of the fellowship. They have a unique stat, Doom, and they have access to dark and powerful magical abilities.</p><p>A <strong>Hard Cut</strong> is a Cut that simply happens. The fellowship cannot react to it in any way, and must simply suffer its consequences.</p><p>Healing items heal 1 damage, either to their user or their user's patient.</p><p><strong>The Heir</strong> is one of the heroes of the fellowship. They are natural leaders, and they are wise and decisive.</p><p>Hope is a bonus you have sometimes, usually when you work together. When you have Hope, you roll three dice and take the best two. Hope and Despair cancel out.</p><p><em><strong>Keep Them Busy</strong></em> is a basic move that rolls +Courage. It is used to stall or hold off an enemy or obstacle and prevent it from harming anyone else.</p><p>A <strong>Little Downtime</strong> is one of the main story-telling frameworks of the game. Downtime is earned after Fellowship is gained (sometimes), and each member of the fellowship has a chance to stock up for the next part of their journey.</p><p>A <strong>Long Journey</strong> is one of the main story-telling frameworks of the game. Journeys are about getting from one place to another, and each member of the fellowship gets a scene to themselves during the journey.</p><p><em><strong>Look Closely</strong></em> is a basic move that rolls +Sense. It is used to find more information about the world around them.</p><p><em>Melee</em> weapons require you to get up close to hit people with them.</p><p>A <strong>Move</strong> is a small rule for handling a specific situation. A move has a Trigger, a Check, and a Result. They cannot be used without meeting the Trigger, and resolving the Check will tell you the Result. The Overlord's moves never have a Check - if you meet the Trigger, the Result happens.</p><p>Necrotic damage causes wounds that do not heal on their own. Necrotic damage is marked twice, and the first mark cannot be removed by Filling Your Belly.</p><p><strong>The Orc</strong> is one of the heroes of the fellowship. They are warriors at heart, and their blood boils with passion.</p><p><strong>Orc-Made</strong> weapons and items are Clumsy in any hands but an orc's.</p><p><em><strong>Overcome</strong></em> is a basic move that rolls +Blood. It is used to block attacks and protect yourself and your allies from harm.</p><p><strong>The Overlord</strong> is the player who controls the bad guys. This term refers to both the person playing at the table, and the Overlord inside the game who is trying to take over or destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Pay the Price</strong> is a special move that defines what a price is. When a move tells you to pay a price, you must give up something or take damage.</p><p>Piercing attacks let the attacker choose which stat they want to damage. Their damage cannot be reduced by armor or redirected by enemy threats.</p><p>A <strong>Playbook</strong> is a collection of rules and abilities that are unique to the player who has that playbook. Only the Dwarf gets to use all the information in The Dwarf playbook, for example. You can get the playbooks here: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks\">http://tinyurl.com/FellowshipPlaybooks</a></p><p>A <strong>Player</strong> is a physical real-world human being who is currently playing Fellowship with you. The Overlord is included in the count whenever players are mentioned.</p><p>A <strong>Powerful Playbook</strong> is stronger than a Basic playbook, but cannot take a Destiny playbook later. The Harbinger is a Powerful playbook.</p><p><em>Precious</em> items can be given to people to <em>Forge a Bond</em> with them, and they are useful for bribing, bartering, or trading with.</p><p>A <strong>Principle</strong> is a hard rule of play that cannot be broken. The fellowship and the Overlord have different Principles from each other.</p><p>A <strong>Proper Challenge</strong> is one of the main story-telling frameworks of the game. Challenges are required to be completed in order to earn a place's Fellowship, learn and thwart the Overlord's plans, or otherwise succeed at a short term goal.</p><p><strong>Ranged</strong> weapons can be used to attack enemies who are far away from you, but they need Ammo or they need to be Reloaded.</p><p><strong>Reload</strong> is a weapon tag for Ranged weapons. Weapons that Reload do not have Ammo, but they can usually only be used once per scene. You can get additional uses by reloading during a scene, but reloading is very slow.</p><p><em><strong>Recover</strong></em> is a special move that describes how to fully restore the fellowship to full capability. Recovering takes time and gives the Overlord a chance to strike.</p><p>A <strong>Result</strong> is the part of a move that happens after you've finished the check. The results are the actual consequences of what you did - how you impacted the story, changed the situation at hand, or the events you set in motion.</p><p><strong>The Rule of Three</strong> states that three or more enemies working together form a Group, thirty or more enemies form a Gang, and three hundred or more enemies form an Army. They must all be same type of enemy, or split between only two different types of enemies.</p><p>A <strong>Scene</strong> starts when the players move to a new place or a new time, and it ends when they move to another new place or time. Some moves can only be used once per scene, and others can only be used between scenes.</p><p>A <strong>Secret</strong> threat does not reveal its stats and moves to the fellowship when confronted.</p><p>Sense is one of the core stats of the fellowship. It is used in the basic moves <em>Look Closely</em> and <em>Talk Sense</em> and represents logic, perception, reasoning, and strategy.</p><p>A <strong>Session</strong> is a unit of measure that covers the amount of time spent playing Fellowship. The session ends when everyone stops for the evening. Fellowship can be expected to take several sessions to complete.</p><p>A <strong>Set Piece</strong> is a combination of several threats that forms a larger, cohesive challenge. A Set Piece can carry an entire session of play by itself, and is a serious hurdle for the fellowship.</p><p><strong>Sharing a Move</strong> is something you will sometimes do, as a result of leveling up or earning Fellowship moves. When you are told to Share a move, you pick any move you know and give it to the player you are sharing the move with. They now have that move.</p><p><strong>The Showdown</strong> is one of the main story-telling frameworks for the game. Showdowns are an interruption to another story brought on by the sudden appearance of the Overlord or one of their Generals.</p><p>Slow items take a long time to Use.</p><p>A <strong>Soft Cut</strong> is a Cut the fellowship can react to before it actually does anything to anyone.</p><p>A Source of Power is a powerful place or item within the world that grants great power to whoever controls it. Seizing a Source of Power gives the Overlord another Threat to the World. If the fellowship seizes a Source of Power, they can remove one of the Overlord's Threats to the World.</p><p><em><strong>Speak Softly</strong></em> is a basic move that rolls +Wisdom. It is used to find more information about someone the fellowship wants to know more about.</p><p><strong>The Spotlight</strong> is a story-telling concept that is used as a means of controlling the flow of play during a game of Fellowship. The Spotlight is the idea that each player gets their own time center-stage, and everyone will get their turn. The Spotlight must be shared regularly and should not be fought over, and it can be helpful to represent it with a token of some kind, like a bean bag, a talking stick, a miniature figurine, or a stuffed animal.</p><p><strong>The Squire</strong> is almost one of the heroes of the fellowship. They are in over their head, but they have more good sense than anyone else around here.</p><p>A <strong>Tag</strong> is a single word with mechanical weight behind it. Anything with a tag has the tag's rules attached to it. For example, the Healing tag means you can Use it to remove damage, and the Slow tag means something takes time and safety to use it properly. Tags usually only describe items and weaponry, but some players can gain tags on themselves, like the orc's Tough As Nails gear option giving them the Armor tag with 2 Uses.</p><p><em>Taken Out</em> is a special move that describes what happens to a member of the fellowship who has taken too much damage.</p><p><strong>Taking A Move</strong> is something you will sometimes do, as a result of leveling up or earning Fellowship moves. When you are told to Take a move, you pick any move from the options available and you now have that move.</p><p><em><strong>Talk Sense</strong></em> is a basic move that rolls +Grace, +Sense, or +Wisdom. It is used to convince someone else to do something for the fellowship.</p><p><strong>Team Playbooks</strong> give the fellowship a communal resource to use, protect, and improve. This book does not have any Team playbooks.</p><p>A <strong>Threat</strong> is a Cut or a Move that enemies and obstacles will use against the fellowship. A Threat can be ignored by using the <em>Overcome</em> move or stopped forever by damaging it.</p><p>A <strong>Threat to the World</strong> is a trait held by the strongest and scariest people in the setting - The Overlord, their Generals, and particularly deadly members of the fellowship. Anyone making a move against a Threat to the World must pay a price first.</p><p><strong>Traps</strong> are items that need to be set up in advance to use them. Once triggered, their effects are unavoidable. Threats to the World cannot take damage from traps.</p><p>A <strong>Trigger</strong> is the first part of a Move. If you do not fulfill a move's Trigger, you cannot use that Move.</p><p>Useful items can be Used to produce something helpful. It can only produce something in line with what the item is. For example, Tunneling Gear can only be used to produce stuff related to Tunneling.</p><p><strong>Uses</strong> describe how many times an item's tags can be triggered before you cannot use it anymore. Many tags require spending Uses to function. These tags are Armor, Food, Healing, Precious, Useful, and Vigor. Some items with Uses have the Drunk tag, which applies its effects whenever the item is Used.</p><p>Vigor is an item tag for an item that fills you with Hope for your next roll. You cannot hold Despair while filled with Vigor.</p><p>The <strong>Overlord's Weakness</strong> causes them great pain. It can only be used against the Overlord once per scene, but when you use it against the Overlord, you choose one of their stats and damage it. None of the Overlord's defenses work against their Weakness.</p><p>Wisdom is one of the core stats of the fellowship. It is used in the basic moves <em>Speak Softly</em> and <em>Talk Sense</em> and represents compassion, experience, persuasion, and teaching ability.</p>"

        "content": "<h2>Clarified Rules</h2><p>Its been a few years since Fellowship first came out, and I've learned a thing or two since then. There's a few questions that have come up several times. This chapter is essentially an FAQ, featuring answers to some of the stranger parts of Fellowship.</p><h3>Get Away vs Overcome?</h3><p><em>Get Away</em> and <em>Overcome</em> are very different moves, but they have one case where they have a lot of overlap. When you want to protect yourself from an incoming attack, which move do you use?</p><p>The two moves have a lot of situations where they have no overlap at all. <em>Get Away</em> is a sneaking move and a travel move, while <em>Overcome</em> can also protect your friends. But when you protect yourself, the line becomes a little more muddy. In that situation, the difference comes down to intent.</p><p>Do you stand your ground or not?<br />If you want to hold position, stop them from getting past you, or otherwise stay where you are for any reason, you need to roll to <em>Overcome</em> their attack. Even if you do it by dodging that fireball, if you're standing your ground, you need to <em>Overcome</em>.</p><p>If you want to run, if you want to just not be here anymore, you can <em>Get Away</em> from their attack. Avoiding attention means they don't know where you went, and avoiding harm means the attack didn't get you.</p><p>But if you roll to <em>Get Away</em>, it means you aren't here anymore. It comes with the intrinsic cost of getting away. Even if you're dodging their attacks while on the run or being chased, if you want to keep their attention or protect something, you need to <em>Overcome</em>.</p><p>If you roll to <em>Get Away</em>, you have to leave, and that can't be avoided. Even if your Grace is way better than your Blood stat, you can't roll to <em>Get Away</em> unless you actually intend to get away, and you will end up being Away.</p><h3><em>Talk Sense</em> vs <em>Finish Them</em> with Wisdom?</h3><p>You don't <em>Talk Sense</em> unless you want them to do something. If you don't want anything from them, <em>Talk Sense</em> isn't the move you want.</p><p>You don't roll to <em>Finish Them</em> unless you want them to stop being a threat. Even if you are just talking them down, if your goal is \"stop being an enemy\" rather than any specific task you want them to do, then <em>Finish Them</em> is the move you need to use.</p><h3>What's the combat move if you don't have Advantage?</h3><p><em>Keep Them Busy</em>, in most cases. Without an advantage to <em>Finish Them</em> with, you cannot hope to cause lasting harm. You can only <em>Keep Them Busy</em>.</p><p>The cases where you don't roll to <em>Keep Them Busy</em> are when you have Custom Moves or Core Moves that let you do otherwise. Orcs don't need an Advantage to <em>Finish Them</em> if they just break their weapon, and an Elf in hiding can use Enemy At The Gates to ambush their enemies. If you don't have any unique moves for dealing damage, however, <em>Keep Them Busy</em> is the basic move you will need to fall back on.</p><h3>The Doom Stat</h3><p>The Doom stat the Harbinger uses is a bit of a hold-over from early versions of the game. There were originally a couple moves that rolled + Doom, but eventually they were all replaced for moves that just Do Things For A Price, since that felt more wizard-like and helps the Harbinger feel cool and unique. Their moves are a skeleton key that you can only use once or twice, and you need to find the best door to open with it.</p><p>So in the first edition of the game, Doom is mostly an extra stat for powering their spells. As such, the wording on Doomed Soul was slightly incorrect, and it has now been fixed. The intention was that if you damage Doom for <em>Don't Trifle With Wizards</em> or <em>Terrible Curse</em>, it doesn't damage your other stats, but as written, any means of damaging Doom will damage another of your stats.</p><p>Doomed Soul now reads \"When your Doom stat gets damaged by an enemy attack, you must damage another one of your stats.\"</p><p>So, the Doom stat exists to be an extra bit of power for the Harbinger to draw on, without giving them extra protection or health compared to other heroes (like the Dwarf has from their Iron stat).</p><p>It's a weird stat that isn't exactly valuable in the way Iron is, but it fulfills its own niche purpose. Exactly how the Harbinger likes it.</p><h3>Companion Stats vs Enemy Threats?</h3><p>This is probably the single most frequently asked question of them all: why are companion's stats listed way in the back of the book? And the answer is: they aren't.</p><p>When something is a Companion, its entire stat is just the stat name. All the text after the name on the Threats in chapter 7 only apply when they are Threats. Companions don't have any of that. To explain more clearly, let's compare the Halfling's Riding Boar to the Wild Boar Threat.</p><p>Riding Boar: These wild beasts are popular among both halfling war riders and halfling chefs.</p><p><strong>Stats:</strong> Pig-Headed, Wild Charge</p><ul><li>Wild Boar: These wild beasts are popular among both halfling war riders and halfling chefs.</li></ul><p>Pig-Headed: Boars are ferocious and territorial beasts. When you gain a Boar's ire, it will chase you until this stat is damaged. They will follow you into a new scene if ignored.</p><p>Wild Charge: When a wild boar charges, it keeps going until it hits something. The first thing in their way that has a damaged Sense stat or is distracted takes 1 damage and is knocked aside by its wild charge. Anyone who is not distracted and has undamaged Senses can easily avoid the charge. If the boar hits nobody, it damages this stat instead.</p><p>When facing a wild boar in battle, you use the second stat block. If you recruit the boar or just have a Riding Boar companion from your Gear, you use the first stat block. All that extra text in the second stat block is useless when the boar is on your side. It only uses the full threat stats when it is a threat. This is why some Companions in chapter 3 are not found in Chapter 7.</p><p>If you want your riding boar to help you, you simply use the Bound In Service special move, on page 26. By damaging a companion's stat, you can have it help you in whatever way the damaged stat can.</p><p>So if the halfling needs to ride their war pig into battle, they could damage the Wild Charge stat to charge on in and get exactly where they need to be. Or they could damage the Pig-Headed stat if they want their pig's tough stubbornness to help out, perhaps by taking a hit for you.</p><h3>When to reveal enemy/set piece stats?</h3><p>Unless a stat is Secret (pg 209), you should reveal enemy stats to the fellowship as soon as it becomes clear that enemy is a threat. Their stats and moves are intended to be public knowledge so the fellowship can size up what they're getting into quickly.</p><p>With a set piece, you only reveal the section of the set piece you are currently on. So if you start a fight with the Wild Dragon (pg 218), they know about the Dragon's Lair section as soon as they enter it. However, until they get to the Dragon's Treasure, those stats remain hidden from them. They don't need to worry about what's ahead until they get there.</p><h3>Hard Cuts vs Soft Cuts?</h3><p>The main difference between a hard cut and a soft cut is that a hard cut doesn't give them a chance to respond.</p><p>Let's use the basic cut \"deal damage\" to illustrate an example.<br />If you say \"the beast pounces towards you, claws outstretched, what do you do?\" That's a soft cut, with clear consequences if they fail to respond to the threat - the beast will hurt you, and maybe pin you down.</p><p>If you say \"you were ambushed! The beast pounces on you, pinning you to the floor. Its claws dig into you, take damage.\" That's a hard cut, where the player had no chance to respond to the danger. It simply happened to them.</p><p>In either case, after performing a cut, you lose the spotlight. The player you hurt or one of their allies now gets the spotlight, and can do something about that ravaging beast. It's just a question of if they get the spotlight before the claws deal damage, or after.</p><p>Also, hard cuts exist for a reason. A lot of new Overlords like to softball their players, with lots of soft cuts that are easy to respond to. You should not do this. Hard cuts are very useful for increasing the danger, so if you want a threat to feel threatening, make it cut hard.</p><p>They still get a chance to respond, so don't feel tempted to keep the kid gloves on forever. The fellowship is strong, they can take it.</p><h3>Overlord limitations?</h3><p>The Overlord can seem overwhelming. Some players wonder how they can ever be beaten. Of course, that's the point - the Overlord should be terrifying and unstoppable. But this is why they have Foibles and a Weakness, and must rely on their Master Plan to accomplish anything.</p><p>The Overlord Foibles (page 183) are very important for keeping the fight fair. The Overlord doesn't want to kill the fellowship, they have some other goal that takes priority. The fellowship will become annoying and may become a priority if they keep getting in the way, but they don't start out as a priority.</p><p>But the most important Foible is Honor-Bound. It may seem contradictory to force your Overlord to keep their word, but its important that the fellowship is able to talk things out with them. It gives them an out, and its an out they know they can rely on, because the Overlord can't break their promises.</p><p>Then there's the Overlord's Master Plan. The Overlord can't accomplish lasting change without going through the various steps of their plan, and this keeps them slow. It gives the fellowship time to react to them and stop them.</p><h3>Overlord strengths?</h3><p>The Overlord can seem weak in the face of a big group of heroes. <em>Keep Them Busy</em> always gives Advantage, so if you just make six 7+ rolls, even a new party can beat the Overlord with three Keep Them Busies into three <em>Finish Thems</em>! Sure the team will take some hits but between all of you, you have the resources to soak up that damage. Right?</p><p>Well, no, its not that easy. The Overlord (and their Generals) have a lot of tricks up their sleeve to prevent them from being steamrolled by a dedicated fellowship.</p><p>Don't forget the Overlord's Basic Moves, like Heart of Iron and <em>Twist The Knife</em>, or any Advances you've picked up, like Heart of Ice or <em>Fear Me!</em> The Overlord has the tools to always stay on top, as long as you remember them.</p><p>Also, your Overlord stats are indisputable fact, so long as they are undamaged. If you are Invincible, then you are actually, truly Invincible, and you cannot take damage until they can take that stat away from you. Until they confront you with your Weakness or else destroy the Source of Power that gives you your Invincibility, that stat will protect you from all harm.</p><p>You an also Chew the Scenery as much as you'd like, so feel free to flaunt your power and emphasize how absolute your Overlord stats are. You decide when they get to roll their moves, not them. If they can't hurt you, they don't get to try. And they need a hell of an Advantage to be better than the Overlord.</p><h3>Instantly Defeated Generals?</h3><p>Unlike the Overlord, a General can lose to a single 10+ <em>Finish Them</em> roll. If they're supposed to be so big and terrifying, working as an arm of the Overlord, why are they so easy to defeat?</p><p>Well, because they're that easy in the stories Fellowship is based on. The hard part of beating a General isn't the beating them part. It's the reaching them part. Once the heroes reach them, they should be able to win.</p><p>So if you want to make your Generals tough, there's three main ways to do it. Option A, give them troops. Option B, make them Tough As Nails. Option C, make them wily and clever.</p><p>If they have troops in the way, it can be hard to challenge the General safely. Use their soldiers to protect them, and make it hard to reach the General without dealing with their forces first.</p><p>If you make a General out of a threat that is Tough As Nails, like an Ogre, a Stone Golem, or the Warmonger, that gives them a buffer hit. When you want a General who can go toe to toe with the fellowship as a big threat by themselves, these threats are ideal for that purpose.</p><p>If a General is wily and clever, they can be very hard to get an Advantage over. Emphasize their fictional positioning, make them slip away easily, and regularly place obstacles between the fellowship and the General. The more frustrating they are to reach, the more satisfying the beat down will be.</p><p>And lastly, Generals still have all the Overlord Basic Moves (page 178). They can <em>Forge a Bond</em> with the fellowship by hurting them and the things they care about, then use those bonds to <em>Twist The Knife</em> or trigger Heart of Iron. These moves are key to making your Generals more than just another minion.</p><h3>Play mean</h3><p>When first starting your game of Fellowship, I find that new Overlords are way too lenient with their players. It's very easy to play softball forever, and let the fellowship steamroll everything in their path.</p><p>But the game plays a lot better when you get a little mean. Not a lot of mean - you should be fans of their characters, after all, and the fellowship will win eventually. But you need to be a little mean, so they have to work for it.</p><p>What I mean by this is, hit 'em hard. Throw real obstacles in their way, and punish the fellowship for failures and missteps. Each hero has a lot of tools to help them overcome adversity in their path, so you need to be that adversity. The heroes are tougher than you think, and you can't kill them outright, so smack em around as hard as you want. Don't you worry - they'll get back up and push onward, because that's what heroes do.</p><h3>Earning Advantage</h3><p>Advantage is mostly about fictional positioning, rather than anything concrete, so it's difficult to define. It is both relative and arbitrary. It also only comes up in a single move, <em>Finish Them</em>, so I never sat down and expanded on what Advantage really is because it wasn't a huge part of the game.</p><p>Except, in play, it actually is, because <em>Finish Them</em> is the most important basic move of them all. Its the move you need to use to win a fight, so you need an Advantage every time you have to win a fight. So let's discuss Advantage in more detail. What is it, and how do you get it?</p><p>Well, first Advantage is relative. You have advantage if you are better than your foe. That's it! Anything that makes you better than them can be an Advantage. A lot of lesser enemies and minions, you should be able to roll <em>Finish Them</em> right away. You don't need to <em>Keep Them Busy</em> or earn your positioning every time. Only when it counts.</p><p>On the flip side, what if they are your equal, or worse, if they are actually better than you? Then you don't get to <em>Finish Them</em>. You need to find a way to get the upper hand. And that can be anything - <em>Keep Them Busy</em> gives you a clear mechanical way to get Advantage, but it is not the only way. In fact, its not even the easiest way.</p><p>Some common advantages use the element of surprise. If you can distract, trick, or ambush them, that's pretty much always an advantage. It's also the main advantage provided by <em>Keep Them Busy</em>.</p><p>But the easy way to get an Advantage, one that the Fellowship always has access to and doesn't need to roll dice for? Teamwork. If you can get three people to surround a single enemy, that's an Advantage. And on top of that, whoever makes the roll will probably get Hope, from The Bonds The Bind Us.</p><p>Now, the Overlord player has final say on what actually counts as an advantage. Simply surrounded a Cloud Giant or a pack of wolves may not be enough. Or it may be. That's up to how dangerous the Overlord thinks you are, and thinks the enemy is, and thinks your method of attack is.</p><p>The other part of earning Advantage is that it's a bit arbitrary. Whether or not you have it can change moment to moment, and what works against one enemy may not work against another. It also varies based on how you intend to <em>Finish Them</em>.</p><p>Your Advantage functions as an explanation for \"why does this method work.\" What do you need to <em>Finish Them</em> in this way? That's your Advantage. The next page goes through each <em>Finish Them</em> stat, and what kinds of Advantage you might need to use them.</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Blood, you need a way to kill them. Your advantage is the means by which they die. Most of the time, you only need a good enough weapon to do the job to roll this move. If they're on your level or better, though, you'll need a distraction, or teamwork, a plan, or maybe just suicidal determination and a burning need for their head on a stick.</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Courage, you need some kind of advantage to represent how you are repelling them. What forces do you have that they can't overcome? What kind of defenses do they have to run up against that makes them wary of you, enough to leave you be? Are you just so good that you can beat them down over and over until they decide to back off?</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Grace, you need to overwhelm them. Terrify them. Out-do them. And you need to do it to such a degree that they'll never mess with you again. A show of force, intimidation, a contest of skill or wit, masterful swordplay, or even bribery - these are all Advantages you could use to make someone decide fighting you isn't worth it.</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Sense, you need to know how to take them out. Your advantage is the weak point you're exploiting to KO them, or cripple their leg, or crush their hand, or however else you're disabling them. <em>Look Closely</em> and <em>Command Lore</em> are good ways to earn this Advantage, because as long as you know where to hit 'em, you have the tool to hit 'em with, and you're within range to reach 'em, that's all you need to knock them senseless.</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with + Wisdom, you need to know why they're doing what they're doing, and why they should not be doing that. You need to show them exactly why they're wrong. Your advantage could be an opportunity to do so, like a chance to save them from harm or to protect someone they were protecting. Or it could be a logical or emotional argument that cuts to the core of who they are, and shows them that maybe you aren't so different after all. Maybe you could even be friends.</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Iron, you need to outlast them. Whether its a slugfest of traded blows, a drinking contest, a marathon, or something else, you both need to set up the contest to outlast them in, and your Advantage must be the way you plan to win. Whether its through cheating or confidence, innate power or borrowed strength, your Advantage is whatever you have that assures you you will win the contest you've set up.</p><p>If you want to <em>Finish Them</em> with +Doom, you need luck on your side. This one's a little trickier to earn Advantage for, because you need to establish that fate or luck would doom them. If you can set up a situation like that, like making them place a bet, traverse something precarious, or about to do something that could backfire, then Doom may befall them yet. That's just the Advantage you need.</p><h3>Designing New Threats</h3><p>Each Fellowship book has dozens of Threats you can draw on, but what if you want to make your own? How do you make a threat balanced and interesting?</p><p>First, most threats have 2 stats. Particularly dangerous ones, like the Organization, may have three, and extremely dangerous ones, like a Titan, can even have four. And particularly non-threatening enemies, like the Horde, may only have one stat each. Give your threat a number of stats based on how threatening you want it to be, usually two or three.</p><p>Here's a list of common stats I find useful for a variety of threats, although any given threat should only have one of these stats:</p><p>Bloodlust: This threat goes into a frenzy at the sight of blood. If your Blood is damaged, this threat's Cuts against you are Hard Cuts.</p><p>Creepy: This threat is terrifying. If your Courage is damaged, you cannot take a stand against this threat.</p><p>Rampage: This threat is difficult to evade. If your Grace is damaged, you cannot defend against this threat's attacks.</p><p>Charming: This threat is pleasant and fun to be around. If your Sense is damaged, they can distract you for as long as they'd like.</p><p>Persuasive: This threat is hard to deny. If your Wisdom is damaged, you will go along with whatever they say.</p><p>Tough As Nails: The first time this threat would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.</p><p>Tough As Can Be: This stat has to be damaged twice.</p><p>Other useful threat moves are \"whenever someone uses Basic Move x against this threat, they must pay a price\" and \"When this stat becomes damaged, do x thing automatically.\"</p><p>The last type of common move is one that either gives the threat a tag, or makes them immune to a tag, such as Piercing or Burning or Ranged.</p><p>These moves are the bread and butter that can make up any new threat you want to make.</p><p>Another trick to make an enemy more interesting is to make one of their stats a drawback. The Organization uses this trick on every single member, where one of their stats is a drawback that makes them weaker at the start of the fight, but they become stronger as the fight goes on.</p><p>Stats stop being true once they have become damaged, so once the Mage Knight takes damage and marks her Arrogance stat, she loses the Arrogance debuff, and becomes stronger halfway through the fight. I'd only use this for a threat with three or four stats, but I highly recommend it. It gives them an extra hit without making them more complicated to deal with, while also making them more interesting enemies to face.</p><p>If the drawback is severe enough, it may even prompt the fellowship to avoid fighting them altogether, in favor of exploiting their drawback until the conflict is over. For example, in one of my fights, I made a stone giant guard a thing they needed, with the stat \"Peaceful: The giant does not want to harm you. Damage this stat if you take the giant's stuff.\"</p><p>Because of this stat, my players refused to hurt the giant, since that would make it fight them (and its other stats were very scary), so they did everything they could to get what they wanted without provoking the giant along the way.</p><p>And lastly, there's hundreds of stats in Chapter 7 to draw from, and every additional threat published in later books is a couple more stats to use for inspiration or to outright steal for your own threats. Making a new threat can be as simple as taking one stat from one and a second stat from another, and putting them together in an interesting way.</p><p>For example, if I wanted to make an ordinary bear, the Owl Bear is a reasonable starting point. The Owl Bear's Blood Hunter stat comes from the Owl part, so let's start our bear with Claws and Death. I want to emphasize the bear's toughness, as opposed to the owl bear's ferocity, so I look through the book and decide to give it the stat Tough As Can Be. And there we go, a new and simple Beast threat to add to the pile:</p><p>Bear: Ferocious and tough, bears are a deadly foe.<br />Claws and Death: When a bear causes damage, it deals a second point of damage. This extra damage can be dealt to either the same target or a different enemy near them.</p><p>Tough As Can Be: This stat has to be damaged twice.</p><p>So, in summary, a threat is just a collection of one to four stats that form a cohesive theme, one of which may be a drawback on stronger threats. A good threat should encourage different ways of approaching a threat, or discourage certain strategies or opponents from facing them.</p><h3>Designing Set Pieces</h3><p>Set Pieces are super neat, but hard to write. Trust me, if they were easier, I'd have written more of them. But because there aren't very many, some folks wanted advice on how to write their own.</p><p>So here it is: How to make your own Set Pieces.</p><p>The first step of designing a Set Piece is to determine what you want it to be. A big boss fight, a thrilling chase sequence, a murder mystery intrigue? It should be something big and flashy, that could take up an entire session by itself, but needs a bit of structure to keep things rolling.</p><p>Once you know what you want to happen, you need to divide it into three (maybe four) pieces. You don't necessarily need to have all three happen in order, although that is usually the case.</p><p>The defining trait of a Set Piece is that it is a phase-based encounter, that changes as you progress through it, and the three piece division is how this trait is enforced. You can divide the set piece into either phases, completed one after the other, or into pieces, which are handled in (roughly) any order.</p><p>Phase-based Set Pieces include The Sports Tournament, The Unstoppable Kraken, The Wild Dragon, and Remove Corruption. In the standard phase-based structure, each phase is as follows:</p><p>Phase 1 introduces the concept. It sets up the ground rules, establishes a staging area for the rest of the set piece, and gives a taste of things to come.</p><p>This phase needs clear direction for how to progress to phase 2 (or maybe phase 3 , if it is possible to skip phase 2 entirely). The general way to do this is to have one stat representing how you advance to phase two, which advances the set piece when that stat is damaged.</p><p>Phase 2 is the escalation. This is everything you need between setup and conclusion, and in many set pieces, is where the bulk of the challenge lies. The situation gets more complicated, and the danger is fully established.</p><p>This phase should increase the danger established in phase 1. The kraken emerges from the depths, the dragon awakens, the true nature of the corruption is revealed, that kind of thing.</p><p>Phase 3 is the conclusion. This is where everything comes to a head, the stakes are at their highest, and the last remaining hurdles get in their way. Once they get past this, the set piece has been fully overcome.</p><p>In some set pieces, the final phase is cleanup. It's where you escape the danger established earlier, like in the Unstoppable Kraken or The Flying Castle. The danger has been defeated, but it left lasting scars or dangers to overcome.</p><p>The fellowship may have disabled the flying castle, but now they need to get out before it crashes! The kraken has been slain, but two players washed ashore on a deserted island and need to survive until the rest of the party can save them! You know, that kind of thing. Come up with a suitable consequence to winning or losing in phase 2, and make dealing with that consequence the goal of phase 3.</p><p>In others, the final phase is an escalation of phase 2. The dragon has escaped and is threatening to ravage the countryside, or it's the finals of the sports tournament, and winner takes all. In this situation, your set piece should raise the stakes from phase 2. The dragon is threatening a nearby town now, or the Organization is actively cheating at sports and you need to expose them to win. Everything is on the line now, and the fellowship will need to do whatever they can to avoid disaster.</p><p>Piece-based Set Pieces include <em>The Treacherous Mountain</em>, <em>The Stone Colossus</em>, and <em>Time To Go!</em> In the standard piece-based set piece, you want the first piece to define the set piece, and the remaining pieces to define the different challenges that must be overcome to defeat the set piece.</p><p>The first piece introduces the concept and defines how to defeat the set piece. For example, it tells you how to kill the Stone Colossus, and what each of its pieces represents. It tells you how to find the routes through the Treacherous Mountain. It tells you the danger you must flee in <em>Time To Go!</em></p><p>In a piece-based set piece, this first piece is by far the most important. It defines the structure of the set piece and tells the players how they win.</p><p>The remaining pieces each define a challenge or protection the core set piece has, such as its weaponry, its defenses, or different routes to victory.</p><p>For example, <em>The Treacherous Mountain</em> has two different paths through, and you only need to get through one to get to the other side of the mountain. So this set piece has two extra pieces, one defining each route, and the first piece of the set piece tells you that you only need to overcome one route to win.</p><p>In an alternative example, <em>The Stone Colossus</em> uses each of its pieces to represent its various dangers. One piece is entirely about its impenetrable defenses, and another is entirely about its weaponry. The entire <em>Stone Colossus</em> set piece is faced all at once; it's just a very very big enemy that needs multiple pieces to describe all of it.</p><p>Hopefully, all of that should help you structure your own Set Pieces. I don't have any specific advice for what a single stat should cover with its move. I sort of play that by ear, when designing my own set pieces. Just divide your set piece up in a way that makes sense and covers everything you think it needs to, and everything should be fine.</p>"
